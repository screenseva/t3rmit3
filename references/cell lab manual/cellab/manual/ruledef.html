<h1 id="i3-CA-ruledef">Defining Rules</h1>

<p>
Each cell in the automaton has eight bits of &ldquo;state&rdquo;
information. The eight state bits are combined to get a number
between 0 and 255. It is important to thoroughly understand the
&ldquo;binary&rdquo; or &ldquo;base two&rdquo; system by which
this is done.  The eight bits in a binary number like
<span class="ttb">11010010</span> are named and weighted from
right to left as follows:
</p>

<table class="ctr">
    <tr>
        <th class="l">Bit number</th>
        <td class="c"> 7</td>
        <td class="c"> 6</td>
        <td class="c"> 5</td>
        <td class="c"> 4</td>
        <td class="c"> 3</td>
        <td class="c"> 2</td>
        <td class="c"> 1</td>
        <td class="c"> 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="l">Value</th>
        <td class="c"> 1</td>
        <td class="c"> 1</td>
        <td class="c"> 0</td>
        <td class="c"> 1</td>
        <td class="c"> 0</td>
        <td class="c"> 0</td>
        <td class="c"> 1</td>
        <td class="c"> 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th class="l" rowspan="2">Weight<br />=</th>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>7</sup><br />128</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>6</sup><br />64</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>5</sup><br />32</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>4</sup><br />16</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>3</sup><br />8</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>2</sup><br />4</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>1</sup><br />2</td>
        <td class="c" rowspan="2"> 2<sup>0</sup><br />1</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
So <span class="ttb">11010010</span> can be viewed as the number
128+64+16+2=210. Another way of characterizing this number would
be to say that it has Bits #1, #4, #6, and #7 turned ON, but it
has Bits #0, #2, #3, and #5 turned OFF. We often think of the
cellular automaton as having eight planes laid over each other,
and a cell's state bits as specifying the cell's one-bit states
in each of the eight planes.  The zero, bottom, or low plane is
the plane that holds Bit #0.  Note that Bit #0 counts as one in
forming the number value of an eight bit state pattern, that Bit
#1 counts as two, Bit #3 counts as four, and so on.  This is
sometimes a cause of confusion.
</p>

<p>
So each cell has a state between binary
<span class="ttb">00000000</span> and <span class="ttb">11111111</span>
(decimal 0 and 255).  For a fully general cellular automaton, we
might expect that at each update each cell can see all eight
bits of each of its eight nearest neighbors.  (Rug, for
instance, is a rule of this nature.) But if we were to implement
such generality for every rule, WebCA would run too slowly.
Instead, most of the rule definitions require only that
each cell be able to see the low bit #0 of its nearest eight
neighbors.  At each generation, each cell has, in other
words, sixteen bits of information to base its new state on: it
has the eight bits of its own present state, and it has 8 bits
of information about its neighbors, one bit (the low #0 bit)
from each.
</p>

<p>
In talking about a cell's neighbors,
we think of a general cell,
designated by &bull;, as being surrounded by eight adjacent cells, named
by the points of the compass.
</p>

<table class="ctr">
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">NW</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">N</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">NE</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">W</span></td>
        <td class="cp">&bull;</td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">E</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">SW</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">S</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">SE</span></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
The eight bits of a cell's own state are called
<em>oldstate</em>, and the eight individual bits of the cell's
neighbors are called <em>NW</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>NE</em>,
<em>E</em>, <em>SE</em>, <em>S</em>, <em>SW</em>, and <em>W</em>
respectively. The cell's new state is called <em>newstate</em>.
Defining a cellular automaton in WebCA involves specifying some
program, function, or lookup table <em>f</em> for computing the
output value for all 64K possible sixteen-bit inputs to the
equation:
</p>

<p class="c">
<em>newstate</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>oldstate, NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W</em>)
</p>

<p>
A cell's extra bits of individual state act like an individual memory.
Keep in mind that a cell can see its own memory bits, but it can't see
the memory bits of the neighbors. All it can see of its neighbors is
their lowest bits.
</p>

<p>
The collection of all the bits representing the primary state of
cells, those bits visible to the neighbors, is referred to as
Plane 0, or the main bit plane. The collection of bits which
hold the local cell state information are referred to as Planes
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. These auxiliary bit planes can be
configured to provide other information to rules, including
random bits for rules which include randomness, spatial textures
for position-dependent rules, and temporal phase for
time-dependent rules. These uses for Planes 1&ndash;7 compensate for
many of the limitations that would normally be imposed by
restricting communication between cells to a single bit of
state.
</p>

<p>
Although most of our rules conform to the description just
given, it is actually possible to create and run other sorts of
rules with WebCA.  The three other general classes of
rules which we allow are as follows:
</p>

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>It is possible to define <em>one-dimensional rules</em>,
    where only the cells on the top line of the screen are
    updated. These one-dimensional modes are invoked by setting
    a variable called <span class="tt">worldtype</span>
    to one of the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, or 9.</li>

    <li>It is possible to define <em>averaging rules</em> where
    the new state depends on the low five bits of
    <em>oldstate</em> and on the full sum of the states of
    EveryCell's Neighbor. In <span class="tt">worldtype</span>
    10, one gets the 11 bit sum of the eight 8-bit neighbors;
    and in <span class="tt">worldtype</span> 11, one looks at
    the 10 bit sum of four 8-bit neighbors.
    <a href="rules.html#Heat">HeatWave</a>
    is an example of an averaging rule which can be
    realized in WebCA by using <span class="tt">worldtype</span>
    10.</li>

    <li>You can create <em>user evaluator rules</em> by writing
    any desired function which returns a sixteen bit number for
    each cell.  User evaluator rules are created by writing a
    JavaScript evaluator function which computes this number.
    One uses this file by loading it with a rule which has its
    <span class="tt">worldtype</span> set to 12 or 13.  The
    <a href="rules.html#Langton">Langton</a> rule is an example
    of such a rule. The user evaluator for Langton looks at
    three bits each of EveryCell and its North, South, East, and
    West neighbors.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A rule of any kind is defined by a function, written in either
JavaScript or Java, which, when called with arguments
representing the state of the cell and its neighbors, calculates
and returns the new state of the cell.  Rule functions are not,
however, used directly while simulating the cellular
automaton&mdash;calling a function for each cell on every step
would run hundreds to thousands of times more slowly than the
simulator operates.  The functional definition of the rule is,
instead, used to define a rule table which maps the state of the
cell and its neighbors into the cell's new state.  This rule
table is either generated directly from a JavaScript definition
or, for a rule defined in Java, written into a <b>.jc</b> file
which can be loaded into WebCA to run the automaton it defines.
</p>

<p>
You can define rules by writing functions in JavaScript or Java.
Let's use the most famous cellular automaton of them all, John
Horton Conway's original game of Life. William Poundstone, in
<cite>The Recursive
Universe</cite> <a href="refs.html#Poundstone85">[Poundstone85]</a>,
gives the rules as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    Each square cell has eight neighboring cells. It adjoins
    four cells on its edges and touches four more at the
    corners. During each moment of time, the player or computer
    counts the number of neighboring cells that are on for each
    and every cell.
    </p>

    <p>
    If, for a given cell, the number of on neighbors is exactly
    two, the cell maintains its status quo into the next
    generation. If the cell is on, it stays on; if it is off, it
    stays off.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the number of neighbors is exactly three, the cell will
    be on in the next generation. This is so regardless of the
    cell's present state.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the number of on neighbors is zero, one, four, five, six,
    seven, or eight, the cell will be off in the next
    generation. There are no other rules.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Let's see how to turn that into code. The following sections
explain how to define rules in JavaScript and Java, and how
to write user evaluators in JavaScript.  Because
most users are likely to use only one language, information is
duplicated in these three sections so that each may serve as a
self-contained guide to rule definition in its respective
language.
