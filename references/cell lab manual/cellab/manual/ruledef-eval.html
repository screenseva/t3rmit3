<h1>User Evaluators</h1>

<p>
This section contains quite advanced material and should not be
tackled until you a) have a thorough familiarity with
<cite>CelLab</cite> and b) understand JavaScript programming.
</p>

<p>
The section arose because Rudy kept asking me to add new modes to the
basic program. First he wanted a one-dimensional mode. Then he
wanted a mode that can see more than one bit of neighbor state so he
could do the Rug rule. Each of these changes involved
adding new code to the main simulator program, which meant I had to keep
remaking all the rulemakers. And each addition only stimulated more
requests. What a drag&hellip;.
</p>

<p>
In order to get out of the business of adding custom evaluator
after custom evaluator, and to completely open the
architecture of the program, rendering it extensible almost
without bound, I implemented &ldquo;user evaluators&rdquo;.
These allow any user to write his own custom inner loop for any
kind of automaton he wishes and have it executed as the update
rule by WebCA, retaining all of the facilities of the program
including the lookup table. This facility is intended for
experienced JavaScript programmers only, but the way in which it
is integrated with WebCA allows new evaluators to
be coded and run with WebCA. Thus WebCA can get smarter without
the need to post updated versions.
</p>

<p>
We have used this facility already to implement several interesting
new evaluators. One performs the optimal solution of Laplace's
equation in the plane. A second implements a general-purpose von
Neumann neighborhood where each cell can see 3 bits of state from each
of its neighbors and four bits of local state. A third implements
Langton's self-reproducing creature.
</p>


<h2 id="javascript">Defining User Evaluators in JavaScript</h2>

<p>
The rules for JavaScript user evaluators are
detailed and highly rigid, but once you understand them the actual job
of coding an evaluator is not all that difficult.  First, let's
examine it from a rule definition standpoint.
<span id="Vonpar">Consider the following
JavaScript rule definition:</span>
</p>

<pre>
/*

    3 bit parity rule for von Neumann neighborhood implemented
    with the vonn3 user evaluator.

*/

rule.worldtype = 13;            // 2D torus world
rule.patreq = "square";
rule.ocodereq = "vonn3";

function vonpar(oldstate) {
    return (oldstate &amp; 7) ^
           ((oldstate &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 7) ^
           ((oldstate &gt;&gt; 6) &amp; 7) ^
           ((oldstate &gt;&gt; 9) &amp; 7);
}
</pre>

<p>
This is a parity rule that works on 3 bits of state in the von
Neumann neighborhood.  Since this is a neighborhood option not
built into WebCA, the rule definition invokes an
user evaluator called &ldquo;<b>vonn3</b>&rdquo; which
implements that custom neighborhood.  It sets <span
class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> to 13 to select a toroidal
world (it would be 12 if open), and a generic look-up table in
which the meaning of the entries is totally up to the user
evaluator's implementation.  The <b>vonn3</b> user evaluator,
implemented in the file <b>vonn3.js</b> is requested by setting
&ldquo;<span class="tt">rule.ocodereq</span>&rdquo; to its file
name (less the &ldquo;<span class="tt">.js</span>&rdquo;, which is
assumed).  User evaluators defined with world types 12 and 13
work with rule definition functions called directly with the raw
lookup table index in <span class="tt">oldstate</span>; the rest
of the rule definition function arguments are undefined.  The
meaning of the 16 bits of <span class="tt">oldstate</span> is
defined by the user evaluator itself.  For <b>vonn3</b> the
assignments are as follows:
</p>

<table class="ctr">
    <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;<span class="tt">oldstate</span> bits&nbsp;</th>
        <th>&nbsp;Meaning&nbsp;</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2"> 2 &ndash; 0</td>
        <td class="cp2"> South</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2"> 5 &ndash; 3</td>
        <td class="cp2"> East</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2"> 8 &ndash; 6</td>
        <td class="cp2"> West</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2"> 11 &ndash; 9</td>
        <td class="cp2"> North</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2"> 15 &ndash; 12</td>
        <td class="cp2"> Self</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Thus, as advertised, 3 bits from each neighbor and four local
bits are visible (the local bits aren't used in this rule
definition).  Since only <span class="tt">oldstate</span> is
passed, the <span class="tt">vonpar</span> function extracts the
neighbors itself from <span class="tt">oldstate</span>.  It
calculates the new value and returns it in the conventional
manner.
</p>

<p>
When this rule definition is loaded into WebCA, it searches for
the file <b>vonn3.js</b> and loads it as a user evaluator.
</p>

<p>
So what are these mysterious user evaluators, and how do I go
about writing one?  Listen up, sharpen your coding stick, and
get ready to be initiated into the gory details of the innards
of WebCA.  First of all, a user evaluator is mechanically a
JavaScript function which is called to update each cell in the
map for every generation of the rule's execution. The evaluator
is, in essence, the &ldquo;inner loop&rdquo; that updates the
state of cells in the state map.  There is no measurable speed
penalty when using a custom evaluator rather than a built-in
evaluator of the same complexity.  Obviously, if you do lots of
computation within the evaluator, WebCA will slow down
accordingly.
</p>

<p id="vonn3">
Let's examine the definition for the <b>vonn3.js</b> user
evaluator.
</p>

<pre>
/*  User evaluator for von Neumann neighborhood with
    3 bits of state visible from each neighbor and 4 bits
    of local state.

    Neighborhood is:

            N
          W C E
            S

    and index to the lookup table is:

        CCCCNNNW WWEEESSS
*/

function vonn3(cells, phyx, phyy, p, lut) {
    var self = cells[p];
    var north = cells[p &minus; phyx];
    var south = cells[p + phyx];
    var east = cells[p + 1];
    var west = cells[p &minus; 1];

    return lut[((self &amp; 0xF) &lt;&lt; 12) |
               ((north &amp; 7) &lt;&lt; 9) |
               ((west &amp; 7) &lt;&lt; 6) |
               ((east &amp; 7) &lt;&lt; 3) |
                (south &amp; 7)];
}
</pre>

<p>
This code appears puzzling until we explain some things about the
arguments with which the evaluator function is called
and the handling of the state map.
</p>

<p>
The job of each call on the evaluator function is to update the cell
whose index in the <span class="tt">cells</span> array (the
old state map) whose index is given by <span class="tt">p</span>,
returning the new state of the cell which will be stored into
the new state map for the next generation.  The
<span class="tt">cells</span> array is a linear vector of cells,
arranged as <span class="tt">phyy</span> lines of
<span class="tt">phyx</span> rows.  Neighbors of the cell being
updated are accessed by arithmetic on the cell's index in
the array as performed by the assignment statements at
the top of the function.  You don't have to worry about
wrap-around or whether the <span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> is
open or closed; that is handled by duplicating cells around the edges
of the map which are updated automatically before the user evaluator
is called.
</p>

<p>
When <span class="tt">p</span> is pointing to a given cell, its
neighbors may be found by the following expressions:
</p>

<table class="ctr">
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2t">NW</td>
        <td class="cp2t">N</td>
        <td class="cp2t">NE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2t">W</td>
        <td class="cp2t">C</td>
        <td class="cp2t">E</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp2t">SW</td>
        <td class="cp2t">S</td>
        <td class="cp2t">SE</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p></p>

<table class="ctt">
    <tr>
        <th>Neighbor</th>
        <th>Address expression</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">NW</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p-(phyx+1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">N</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p-phyx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">NE</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p-(phyx-1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">W</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p-1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">C</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">E</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p+1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">SW</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p+(phyx-1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">S</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p+phyx</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="c">SE</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p+(phyx+1)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
While all of our standard patterns assume a 320&times;200 cell map,
the simulator will actually work on a map of any size.  You should
always use the <span class="tt">phyx</span> and
<span class="tt">phyy</span> dimension arguments so your
evaluators will as well.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to supply modal information to the rule, you can
encode 8 bits of information in the
&ldquo;<span class="tt">rule.reqauxp</span>&rdquo; variable in the rule
definition function.  For user evaluator rules this cell does not
cause any special treatment of plane 1, but instead is simply
passed to the evaluator function in this variable.  The
interpretation of this value is totally up to the evaluator.
</p>

<p>
The built-in logic that calls your user evaluator takes care of
toroidal wrap around and supplying zero neighbors for open
worlds.  As long as your evaluator addresses the neighbors with
the expressions given above, it doesn't have to worry about
wraparound or world type.  When used with an evaluator, the
lookup table has no predefined meaning&mdash;it's simply 64K of
data to which the evaluator assigns its own interpretation. 
Consequently, JavaScript or Java rule definitions which use user
evaluators must be coded with an understanding of what the
evaluator expects to find in the lookup table.  (Note that if
you really want to go off the deep end, there isn't any reason
own code can't <em>change</em> the lookup table as it's
running.) Some evaluator functions don't even need the lookup
table at all.
<span id="i3-CA-Laplace">For example, here's a definition of
<b>laplace.js</b></span> which solves the Laplace equation
in the plane using the formula:
</p>

<p class="c">
<i>New</i> = ((<i>N</i> + <i>S</i> + <i>E</i> + <i>W</i>) &times; 4 +
    (<i>NW</i> + <i>NE</i> + <i>SW</i> + <i>SE</i>)) / 20
</p>

<pre>
/*  User evaluator for the Laplace averaging.  All
    computation is in the code: no lookup table is
    used.  */

function laplace(cells, phyx, phyy, p, lut) {
    //  Compute Laplace average of neighbors
    //      LaplaceAverage = (4 &times; (N + E + S + W) +
    //      (NW + NE + SE + SW)) / 20
    var s = 0;

    s += cells[p &minus; phyx];           // n
    s += cells[p &minus; 1];              // w
    s += cells[p + 1];              // e
    s += cells[p + phyx];           // s
    s *= 4;

    s += cells[p &minus; (phyx + 1)];     // nw
    s += cells[p &minus; (phyx &minus; 1)];     // ne
    s += cells[p + (phyx &minus; 1)];     // sw
    s += cells[p + (phyx + 1)];     // se

    return Math.floor((s + 10) / 20);
}
</pre>

<p>
Since this code computes the new value arithmetically from the
neighbor cells, it doesn't bother with the lookup table. A
JavaScript or Java rule definition that called it would just
always return zero from its rule definition function.
</p>

<p>
User evaluators should be short, sweet, and simple. Evaluators
of the complexity shown here run at speeds comparable to the
built in rule evaluators of WebCA. If you need to
do lots of computation, try to find a way to reduce it to table
lookup or else you're likely to be disappointed at how fast your
rule executes.
</p>

<p>
For an example of what can be done with a user evaluator, please refer
to the definition of
<a href="rules.html#Langton">Langton's self-reproducing machine</a>.  The
evaluator for this rule (essentially identical to the
<b>vonn3</b> example given above) is defined in
<b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/evaluators/langton.js"
    rel="Target:CelLabAux">evaluators/langton.js</a></b>.
The rule definition which generates the
complicated lookup table used by the evaluator is defined in the
JavaScript file <b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/ruledefs/langton.js"
    rel="Target:CelLabAux">ruledefs/langton.js</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a lookup table that you'd like to run with several
different evaluators, you can explicitly load an evaluator
from the WebCA control panel.  You can see a list of
<a href="ruledef-eval.html#stdeval">standard evaluators</a> in the drop-down list
on the Evaluator URL line.
</p>

<p>
As you come to master the craft of evaluator design, your
horizons will suddenly broaden as you come to realize the extent that
WebCA places you in control. Appropriate code, written with a
thorough understanding of the internal environment seen by the
evaluator, can implement such things as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Optimized evaluation, skipping inactive regions at high
        speed.</li>
    <li>Position-sensitive evaluation, for example preserving
        a constant frame on the screen.</li>
    <li>Non-state inputs (random numbers, etc.).</li>
    <li>Non-local neighbors.</li>
    <li>Temporal phase (for example, alternating block rules).</li>
    <li>Continuous-valued cells.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your imagination and JavaScript coding skills are truly the
only limits to what you can accomplish with user evaluators.
</p>

<h3>Evaluator Local Storage</h3>

<p>
Sometimes an evaluator will need some storage, usually constants
but sometimes variables, which persists over multiple calls
on the evaluator.  Initializing these variables on every call
to the evaluator would be costly in compute time and slow down
the simulator: for a standard map of 320&times;200 cells the
evaluator function is called 64,000 times for <em>each generation</em>
of the automaton.  WebCA provides an object named
<span class="tt">rule.evaluator</span> where evaluators can
keep such information.  Variables are initialized by code in the
prologue to the evaluator, before the declaration of the evaluator
function.  This code is executed only once, when the evaluator is
initially loaded, and variables it creates can be accessed on
subsequent calls to the evaluator function.
</p>

<p>
For example, one of our evaluators simulates diffusion of a
gas by randomly selecting a neighbor of a particle and swapping
the particle with it.  To do this efficiently, we need a table
of the offsets of the neighbors from the current cell.
Creating this array for every call on the evaluator would
dramatically slow down the simulation, so we declare the
array in the prologue as follows:
</p>

<pre>
//  Indices of neighbors for random propagation direction
rule.evaluator.nindex = [ &minus;(map[0].phyx + 1), &minus;map[0].phyx, &minus;(map[0].phyx &minus; 1),
                                  &minus;1,                                1,
                           (map[0].phyx &minus; 1),  map[0].phyx,  (map[0].phyx + 1) ];

function gasflow(cells, phyx, phyy, p, lut) {
                        &#8942;
</pre>

<p>
then, within the <span class="tt">gasflow</span> evaluator
function, code can reference the
<span class="tt">rule.evaluator.nindex[]</span> array, which
will already have been initialized before the evaluator is
called the first time.  Storage in <span class="tt">rule.evaluator</span>
is released when another evaluator is loaded.  (Note that when
the prologue is executed, the evaluator function arguments
have not been set, so the assignment which creates the
<span class="tt">rule.evaluator.nindex</span> array must
obtain the physical width of the map directly using
<span class="tt">map[0].phyx&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>, etc.)
</p>

<h3>Evaluator Notification Functions</h3>

<p>
While most evaluators need do nothing more than update the current
cell, some may need to special processing, for example at the start
and/or end of each generation.  While it is possible to test for
this by examining the <span class="tt">p</span> argument to
detect the first or last cell, making this test for every cell
slows down the evaluator.  WebCA allows an evaluator to register
notification functions for such events by assigning functions to
the following variables in <span class="tt">rule.evaluator</span>.
</p>

<h4 class="tt">generationStart</h4>

<p>
The function will be called for each generation, before the
evaluator function is called to update the first cell.  For
example, to perform some processing before each generation,
you'd add code like the following to the prologue of the
evaluator.
</p>

<pre>
rule.evaluator.generationStart = function () {
    //  Perform processing before generation
};
</pre>

<h4 class="tt">generationEnd</h4>

<p>
The function is called once each generation, after the last cell
has been updated by evaluator function.
</p>

<h4 class="tt">generationFirst</h4>

<p>
The function is called before the very first time the evaluator
is called, before its <span class="tt">generationStart</span>
function, if any.  A variable named
<span class="tt">rule.evaluator.generationFirstDone</span>
is set true to indicate the <span class="tt">generationFirst</span>
function has been called.  If the evaluator sets it back to
<span class="tt">false</span>,
<span class="tt">generationFirst</span> will be called again on the
next invocation of the evaluator.
</p>

<h4 class="tt">onChange</h4>

<p>
The function will be called whenever a new rule or pattern is
loaded, with a string argument of
&ldquo;<span class="tt">rule</span>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<span class="tt">pattern</span>&rdquo;
to indicate which has changed.
</p>

<h2 id="stdeval">Standard Evaluators</h2>

<p>
The following evaluators, defined as described above, are
available on the WebCA server.  You can load them from your rule
definition programs, or explicitly from the drop-down list in
the <a href="webca.html#evalload">Evaluator</a> section of the
WebCA control panel by entering the name in the &ldquo;Evaluator
URL&rdquo; box and pressing &ldquo;Load&rdquo;.  If one of the
standard evaluators does not meet your needs, you still may find
one which is close enough to serve as a starting point which you
can modify into one that does.  Source code for all of the
standard evaluators is included in the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/index.html#devkit"><cite>CelLab</cite>
Development Kit</a> in the <span class="tt">evaluators</span>
directory.
</p>

<p>
In discussing the evaluators, we will use the following
terminology to refer to a cell's neighbors.  The cell the
evaluator is updating, EveryCell, is denoted by
<span class="tt">C</span>, and
is surrounded by eight adjacent cells, named by the points of
the compass.
</p>

<table class="ctr">
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">NW</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">N</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">NE</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">W</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">C</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">E</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">SW</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">S</span></td>
        <td class="cp"><span class="tt">SE</span></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="e_cfd">cfd</h3>

<p>
This is a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics
simulator which runs as an evaluator.  Each cell's state is
represented by twelve floating-point values which specify the
density and velocity of the fluid within it and its neighbors.
This evaluator is used by the <a href="rules.html#Wind">Wind</a>
rule; see its documentation for details and attribution of
the work upon which it is based.  This evaluator is extremely
computationally intense, and requires a high-performance
machine and browser implementation of JavaScript to run at
an acceptable speed.  The evaluator does not use the lookup
table, and examines the map only to determine the location of
obstacles (indicated as cells with state 255) to fluid flow.
</p>

<h3 id="e_forest">forest</h3>

<p>
This is a special purpose evaluator built to support the
<a href="rules.html#Forest">Forest</a> sample rule.  It is
unlikely to be useful for any other purpose.
</p>

<h3 id="e_gasflow">gasflow</h3>

<p>
This evaluator implements gas flow
through randomness, and is used by the
<a href="rules.html#Gasflow">Gasflow</a> sample rule.  It is
configured by variables in the prologue section.  Cells which
have the bit set in
<span class="tt">wall</span> are impermeable walls; set to
zero to disable walls.  Every <span class="tt">percent</span>
of generations (0&ndash;100), cells will be displaced in a
random direction, swapping with their neighbors.  The
<span class="tt">flow</span> parameter (0&ndash;100)
gives the percent bias a cell has not to flow in the
directions specified in the <span class="tt">nogo</span>
array (by default configured for left to right flow).  The
lookup table is not used.  This rule conserves particle
number.
</p>

<h3 id="e_gaswall">gaswall</h3>

<p>
This evaluator simulates gas diffusion
through randomness.  It is configured by variables
in the prologue section.  Cells which have the bit set in
<span class="tt">wall</span> are impermeable walls; set to
zero to disable walls.  Every <span class="tt">percent</span>
of generations (0&ndash;100), cells will be displaced in a
random direction, swapping with their neighbors.The
lookup table is not used.  This rule conserves particle
number.  This evaluator is equivalent to <b>gaswall</b>
with <span class="tt">flow</span> set to zero, and is used
in the <a href="rules.html#PerfumeT">PerfumeR</a> sample
rule.
</p>

<h3 id="e_langton">langton</h3>

<p>
This evaluator is used by the <a href="rules.html#Langton">Langton</a>
self-reproducing sample rule, but can be used whenever you need to
see three bits of state from the four neighbors
<span class="tt">N</span>,
<span class="tt">E</span>,
<span class="tt">S</span>,
<span class="tt">W</span>, plus
four bits of your own state,
<span class="tt">C</span>.  The lookup table index is assembled
with bits as follows.
</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="tt">C C C C N N N E &nbsp; E E S S S W W W</span>
</p>

<h3 id="e_laplace">laplace <span class="n">and</span> lapinc</h3>

<p>
These evaluators compute the Laplace average of their
eight surrounding neighbors with the formula:
</p>

<p class="c">
<em>new</em> = ((<em>N</em> + <em>S</em> + <em>E</em> +
    <em>W</em>) &times; 4 + (<em>NW</em> + <em>NE</em> +
    <em>SW</em> + <em>SE</em>)) / 20
</p>

<p>
The <b>laplace</b> evaluator returns <em>new</em>, while <b>lapinc</b>
returns <em>new</em>+1.  Neither uses the lookup table.  The
<a href="rules.html#Rug">RugLap</a> sample rule uses <b>lapinc</b>.
You can use <b>laplace</b> when you need a more accurate
average than that provided by world type 10.
</p>

<h3 id="e_margolus">margolus <span class="n">and</span> margolusp</h3>

<p>
The Margolus neighborhood is discussed in the
<a href="chap4.html#i4-TH-lattice">Lattice Gas</a> section of the
<cite><a href="chap4.html">Theory</a></cite> chapter.  It is
possible to implement a lattice gas in the standard WebCA
world type 0 or 1 by devoting bits in the cells' states to
keep track of horizontal, vertical, and temporal phase, then
writing out special cases in the rule program to handle all of
the possibilities.  Our <a href="rules.html#PerfumeT">PerfumeT</a>
and PerfumeX rules are examples of this technique.
</p>

<p>
While it is possible to do this, the complexity of keeping track
of the phases and handling the special cases can dwarf that of the
actual rule.  The PerfumeX rule definition, for example, is 200
lines of JavaScript, most devoted to twiddling bits and enumerating
cases, with only a few actually expressing the rule.  Further, using
bits in the cell state to keep track of phase makes them unavailable
to the rule definition, which may wish to use them for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
The <b>margolus</b> evaluators eliminate this complexity by keeping
track of phase externally, in the evaluator, without bothering the
rule program with such details.  Rewritten to use the <b>margolus</b>
evaluator, the PerfumeM rule (identical in results to PerfumeX)
is just 35 lines of code, of which 10 express the entire rule.
</p>

<p>
How does this work?  Well, recall that in the Margolus neighborhood,
neighbors are denoted by the relationship to the current cell, in its
position in the block for the present generation, by their rotation
from the cell:
<span class="tt">CW</span> (clockwise),
<span class="tt">CCW</span> (counterclockwise), or
<span class="tt">OPP</span> (opposite).
</p>

<p>
The <b>margolus</b> evaluator computes a lookup table index in
which the lower eight bits are the state of the current cell
and the high eight bits are composed of the states of the
four relative Margolus neighbors and the vertical and horizontal
phases as follows:
</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="tt">CW1 CW0 CCW1 CCW0 OPP1 OPP0 V H</span>
</p>

<p>
where the &ldquo;<span class="tt">1</span>&rdquo; and
<span class="tt">0</span>&rdquo; denote bit planes of the neighbors
(thus you get to see two bits of the state of the neighbors)
and &ldquo;<span class="tt">V</span>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span class="tt">H</span>&rdquo; the vertical and
horizontal phases (which will be 1 for odd numbered rows and
columns, respectively, and 0 for those with even numbers).
Many rules won't need the &ldquo;<span class="tt">V</span>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;<span class="tt">H</span>&rdquo; bits, but they're
supplied just in case.
</p>

<p>
The index computed by <b>margolusp</b> is almost the same:
</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="tt">CW1 CW0 CCW1 CCW0 OPP1 OPP0 0 P</span>
</p>

<p>
where &ldquo;<span class="tt">P</span>&rdquo; is the temporal
phase: 0 for even-numbered generations and 1 for odd-numbered
generations.  Due to the limit of 16 bits on lookup table indices,
it isn't possible to simultaneously supply vertical, horizontal,
and temporal phase to a rule, but if it's needed, a housekeeping
bit can be devoted to keeping track of the phase not supplied
by the evaluator.
</p>

<h3 id="e_meltdown">meltdown</h3>

<p>
This evaluator causes the cells in a map to &ldquo;melt down&rdquo;
into a histogram at the bottom, sorted by their states.  You can
run it with the null Owncode rule to create a column by column
histogram of the results of running another rule.  This evaluator
is similar to the <span class="tt">SAFE-PASS</span> rule
described in
<a href="refs.html#Margolus_Toffoli87">[Margolus&amp;Toffoli87]</a>,
p.&nbsp;78.  It uses neither the lookup table nor housekeeping bits in
the cells.
</p>

<h3 id="e_randgas">randgas</h3>

<p>
Simulates random gas diffusion by swapping cells with randomly
chosen neighbors.  The prologue variable <span class="tt">percent</span>
gives the probability (0&ndash;100) that a cell will be swapped
in a generation.  It is identical to <b>gaswall</b> with
<span class="tt">wall</span> set to zero.  No lookup table is used,
and the evaluator does not examine the states of cells.  This
evaluator is used by the <a href="rules.html#Earthgas">Earthgas</a>
sample rule.
</p>

<h3 id="e_randnabe">randnabe</h3>

<p>
A cell from among the eight neighbors of a cell is chosen at
random, and its state and the state of the current cell are used
to form a 16 bit lookup table index with the neighbor's cell in
the top 8 bits and the cell's state in the bottom 8 bits.  The
value at this index in the lookup table becomes the cell's new
state.  The <b>randnabe</b> evaluator is used in the
<a href="rules.html#Griff">Griff</a> sample rule.
</p>

<h3 id="e_randswap">randswap</h3>

<p>
One of the cell's eight neighbors is chosen at random, and new
values for the cell and its neighbor are taken from the lookup
table at indices formed by the neighbor's state in the high
byte and the cell's state in the low byte (for the cell) and
with the order of the two bytes reversed (for the neighbor).
Then the cell and the neighbor are physically interchanged in
the map.  This evaluator is used by the
<a href="rules.html#Wator">Wator</a> sample rule.
</p>

<h3 id="e_runny">runny</h3>

<p>
Simulates runny paint by causing nonzero state cells to run down
the map through areas of zero cells until they all collect at the
bottom.  Unlike <b>meltdown</b>, the cells at the bottom are not
sorted by their states, but remain in their original vertical
order.  This is an example of an evaluator which updates the
entire map at once, rather than cell by cell.
</p>

<h3 id="e_sand">sand</h3>

<p>
Performs the recursive evolution of the sandpile model for the
<a href="rules.html#Sand">Sand</a> rule.  Each generation adds
a grain of sand to the center of the map and then propagates
any avalanches which result.  No lookup table is used.
</p>

<h3 id="e_semi4">semi4 <span class="n">and</span> semi8</h3>

<p>
Computes the sum of the four neighbors of the cell (<b>semi4</b>)
or eight neighbors (<b>semi8</b>) and returns the value from
the lookup table with that index.  The sample rule
<a href="rules.html#Rug">Rug</a> uses <b>semi8</b> and
RugF uses <b>semi4</b>.
</p>

<h3 id="e_turmite">turmite</h3>

<p>
This is a special purpose evaluator built to support the
<a href="rules.html#Turmite">Turmite</a> sample rule.  It is
unlikely to be useful for any other purpose.
</p>

<h3 id="e_vonn3">vonn3</h3>

<p>
Computes a lookup table index composed of three bits of
state from the four neighbors and four bits of state from
the cell, arranged as follows:
</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="tt">C C C C N N N W &nbsp; W W E E E S S S</span>
</p>

<h3 id="e_vonn4">vonn4</h3>

<p>
Computes a lookup table index composed of four bits of
state from each of the four neighbors and four bits of state from
the cell, arranged as follows:
</p>

<p class="c">
<span class="tt">C C C C &nbsp; N N N N W W W W &nbsp; E E E E  S S S S</span>
</p>

<p>
If you've been reading carefully, you're probably exclaiming,
&ldquo;<em>Wait a minute!</em>  You told me lookup table indices
are sixteen bits, but here you have a twenty-bit index!&rdquo;
Indeed&hellip;.  The <b>vonn4</b> evaluator is an example of
an evaluator which uses an <em>auxiliary lookup table</em> which
can be larger than the standard 64K lookup table used by most
other evaluators.  In this case the lookup table is one megabyte
in length, allowing it to be addressed with a 20 bit index.  The
auxiliary lookup table is stored in the <b>rule.program.lutaux</b> array
and must be computed and stored there by the rule definition program
which uses the <b>vonn4</b> evaluator.  To understand how to write
rules definitions and evaluators that use an auxiliary lookup table,
see the source code for <b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/evaluators/vonn4.js"
    rel="Target:CelLabAux">evaluators/vonn4.js</a></b> and
<b><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/ruledefs/vonpar4.js"
    rel="Target:CelLabAux">ruledefs/vonpar4.js</a></b>, a four
bit per cell parity rule that uses <b>vonn4</b>, in the
<cite>Cellab</cite> Development Kit. The <b>vonn4</b> evaluator
is used by the <a href="rules.html#Evoloops">Evoloops</a>
standard rule.  The <b>vonn4ab</b> evaluator is a modified
version of <b>vonn4</b> used by EvoloopsAB; it is unlikely to be
useful with any other rule.
</p>

<h3 id="e_water">water</h3>

<p>
The <b>water</b> evaluator is intended to demonstrate how far
off the deep end you can go with user evaluators. 
Appropriately, it is intended to simulate fluid flow, although
more one with a high viscosity such as honey as opposed to water
(since the momementum of the fluid is not taken into account). 
It is based upon a simulation originally written in Java by
Janis Elsts (W-Shadow) and
<a href="http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/09/01/simple-fluid-simulation/"
    rel="Target:CelLabAux">described on his Web log</a>.
</p>

<p>
The evaluator is used in the
<a href="rules.html#Glooper">Glooper</a>
sample rule which, unlike almost all of our other rules, is a
<em>continuous</em> rule. Cells, instead of having discrete
values between 0 and 255, take on values with more than six
significant digits of precision (IEEE single-precision floating
point), which represent the mass of fluid in each cell. 
Compressibility, the force of gravity, the pressure of a column
of fluid, and lateral flow among cells with different pressures
are taken into account.
</p>

<p>
You can draw complex &ldquo;water works&rdquo; and watch the
fluid flow through them.  If you're interested in implementing
ambitious projects such as computational fluid dynamics in
<cite>CelLab</cite>, <b>water</b> shows you how to go about
it, and <b>cfd</b> demonstrates what can be achieved.
</p>

<h3 id="owncode_rule">The Owncode Rule Definition</h3>

<p>
Many evaluators work directly on the state map and do not require
a lookup table.  For such rules, the only function served by the
rule definition program is to specify the evaluator, pattern,
palette, and rule modes.  When you're developing and experimenting
with such evaluators, there's no need to write a rule definition
for each one.  WebCA supplies a generic rule definition named
Owncode (available both as a compiled <b>.jc</b> file and a
JavaScript rule program) which sets the world type to 13 but does
nothing else.  You can then manually load your evaluator, pattern,
palette (if desired) and set any rule modes you require with the
<a href="webca.html#rulemodes">Rule Modes</a> dialogue.
