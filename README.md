# T3rmit3 - Turmite Cellular Automaton Simulator

A web-based simulator for exploring Turmite cellular automata, featuring multiple rule presets, interactive controls, and pattern generation capabilities.

## Features

- Multiple rule presets including Langton's Ant, Spiral, Highway, and more
- Custom rule creation and modification
- Interactive grid controls (zoom, pan, step size)
- Pattern generation (square, cross, circle, random, etc.)
- Real-time simulation visualization
- Edge detection for optimal turmite placement
- Multi-state cell support (white, black, gray, dark gray)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prajjwalsingh/t3rmit3.git
cd t3rmit3
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## Usage

- Click "Start" to begin the simulation
- Use the dropdown menu to select different rule presets
- Modify parameters in real-time using the control panel
- Create custom rules by adjusting state transitions and rotations
- Generate patterns using the pattern selector
- Adjust simulation speed and step size as needed

## Rule Presets

- **Langton**: Classic Langton's ant behavior
- **Spiral**: Creates spiral patterns
- **Highway**: Generates highway-like structures
- **Crystal**: Forms crystalline patterns
- **Maze**: Creates maze-like structures
- **Chaos**: Produces chaotic, unpredictable patterns
- And many more...
