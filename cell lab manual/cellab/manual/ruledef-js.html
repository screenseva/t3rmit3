<h1>Defining Rules in JavaScript</h1>

<p>
To define a rule in JavaScript, you write a rule function which,
when called with an argument containing the state of a cell and
the state of its neighbors in variables, returns the new state
for the cell as an integer from 0 to 255 (the low bit #0 is the
state of Plane 0, bit #1 is the state of Plane 1 and so on). 
The rule function program is loaded into a text box in the WebCA
page, and run to generate the lookup table for the rule.
</p>

<p>
Recapitulating, use your text editor to write a program called
<b>mylife.js</b>.  Then paste the program into the Rule Program
box in WebCA, press &ldquo;Generate&rdquo; to run it and
generate the rule table, and now you're ready to run the rule by
pressing the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; button below the map display.
</p>

<p>
To understand how to write a rule
program, first we must consider the neighborhood of a cell, as
seen by the function through its arguments.  The rule is defined as
a function of the form:
</p>

<pre>
function <em>ruleName</em>(oldstate,
    	    	    	    nw, n  , ne,
                     	    w, self, e,
                      	    sw, s  , se
                          ) {
    var newSelf;

    //  Calculate value for newSelf

    return newSelf;
}
</pre>

<p>
The rule function sees the neighborhood
through the following arguments:
</p>

<table class="ctr" style="font-family: monospace;">
    <tr>
        <td class="cp">nw</td>
        <td class="cp">n</td>
        <td class="cp">ne</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp">w</td>
        <td class="cp">self</td>
        <td class="cp">e</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="cp">sw</td>
        <td class="cp">s</td>
        <td class="cp">se</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
Each of these variables will be 1 if the low-order bit of the
corresponding cell in the neighborhood is on, and 0 if it is
off. In addition, the rule function may examine the argument
<span class="tt">oldstate</span>, which contains the full state
of the center cell (eight bit planes). Thus,
<span class="tt">oldstate</span> ranges from 0 to 255, with the
presence of low bit (also supplied in variable
<span class="tt">self</span>) signifying the state of Plane 0.  The
function defining the rule must examine these input variables,
calculate the resulting state for the cell (from 0 to 255), and
return that value. The following sample code, including the
required declarations and main program, defines the game of
Life, proceeding directly from Poundstone's description.
</p>

<pre>
function mylife(oldstate,
    	    	    nw, n  , ne,
            	    w, self, e,
              	    sw, s  , se
              ) {
    var eightSum, newSelf = 0;

    /*  We sum up the number of firing neighbor cells.  If this
        eightSum is anything other than 2 or 3, the cell gets
        turned off.  If the eightSum is 2, the cell stays in its
        present state.  If the eightSum is 3, the cell gets turned
        on.  */
    eightSum = nw + n + ne + e + se + s + sw + w;
    
    switch (self) {
        case 0:
            if (eightSum == 3) {
                newSelf = 1;
            } else {
                newSelf = 0;
            }
            break;

        case 1:
            if (eightSum == 2 || eightSum == 3) {
                newSelf = 1;
            } else {
                newSelf = 0;
            }
            break;
    }

    return newSelf;
}
</pre>

<p>
You can try pasting the program above into the Rule Program box
of WebCA, press &ldquo;Generate&rdquo;, and then press
&ldquo;Start&rdquo; to watch the <b>mylife</b> rule run.
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, the <b>life.js</b> rule program provided with
<cite>CelLab</cite> is similar but not quite the same as
<b>mylife</b>.  Our Life is actually the rule
&ldquo;LifeMem,&rdquo; which colors the cells differentially
depending on their state in the last generation.  But our
<b>life.js</b> is quite similar to what you want for
<b>mylife.js</b>, so you should copy <b>life.js</b> onto
<b>mylife.js</b> and use that as the starting point for your
program.
</p>

<p>
So the steps for running mylife are as follows: copy the
existing <b>life.js</b> file to a new <b>mylife.js</b>
file.  Then use your text editor to work on <b>mylife.js</b>.
Once you have <b>mylife.js</b> in shape, paste it into
the Rule Program box of WebCA, press Generate, then press
Start.
</p>


<p id="Brain-js">
Since the rule for the game of Life doesn't use bit-planes #1
through #7 at all, the <b>mylife.js</b> rule program contains
no reference to <span class="tt">oldstate</span>.  Rules which
use the higher bit-planes may also be specified
straightforwardly by JavaScript rule definition functions. For
example, here is the definition of
<a href="rules.html#Brain">Brian's Brain</a>, a rule
developed by Brian Silverman and described in
<a href="refs.html#Margolus_Toffoli87">[Margolus&amp;Toffoli87]</a>, p. 47, as:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>
    The rule involves cells having three states, 0
    (&ldquo;ready&rdquo;), 1 (&ldquo;firing&rdquo;). and 2
    (&ldquo;refractory&rdquo;). A ready cell will fire when
    exactly two of its eight neighbors are firing; after firing
    it will go into a refractory state, where it is insensitive
    to stimuli, and finally it will go back to the ready state.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This translates directly into a JavaScript program as follows:
</p>

<pre>
/*
    Each cell has three states, though only one bit of the state
    is used to determing whether neighbors are on or off.  The
    rule is as follows:

      Old cell state       New state

      0 (Ready)             1 if exactly 2 neighbors in state 1,
                            0 otherwise.
      1 (Firing)            2
      2 (Refractory)        0
*/

function brain(oldstate,     nw, n  , ne,
                             w, self, e,
                             sw, s  , se) {
    var count = nw + n + ne + w + self + e + sw + s + se;

    if (oldstate == 2) {       // If in refractory state...
       return 0;               // ...become ready.
    }
    if (oldstate == 1) {       // If firing...
       return 2;               // ...go to refractory state.
    }
    return (count == 2) ? 1 : 0; /* If ready, fire if precisely
                                    two neighbors are firing. */
}
</pre>

<p id="Sublime-js">
It is possible to define much more complicated rules by using
the high bits for various bookkeeping purposes.  Here is an
example of a rule that simulates thermally driven random
diffusion. The theory of <a href="chap4.html#i4-TH-lattice">why
the program works</a> is explained in the <a
href="chap4.html"><cite>Theory</cite></a> chapter.
</p>

<pre>
/*

    This rule implements the Margolus rule for simulating a gas of
    cells diffusing.  Particle number is conserved.  We set up a
    lattice of position values that looks like this:

                    0 1 0 1 ..
                    2 3 2 3 ..
                    0 1 0 1 ..
                    2 3 2 3 ..
                    : : : :

    This lattice is alternately chunked into

           A blocks 0 1   and  B blocks 3 2
                    2 3                 1 0

    and the blocks are randomly rotated one notch CW or one notch CCW.

    We use the eight bits of state as follows:

    Bit  #0 is used to show info to neighbors
    Bit  #1 is the gas bit
    Bit  #2 is fed by the system Noiseizer
    Bit  #3 stores the 4-cell consensus on direction 0 is CCW, 1 is CW
    Bits #4 &amp; #5 hold a position numbers between 0 and 3
    Bits #6 &amp; #7 control the cycle

</pre>

<p>
For now don't worry about the intricacy of the definition
of the <span class="tt">sublime</span> function.  Instead, let's
focus on the assignment statements before the function
declaration, which we haven't encountered before.  These
statements make up what we call the &ldquo;prologue&rdquo; of
the rule program, and are executed before the rule is generated.
They can set up various modes which affect how the rule is
generated and/or perform any initialization needed by the rule
function.  <b>mylife</b> and <b>brain</b> didn't need to change
any of the modes from the defaults, so their definitions didn't
include a prologue.
</p>

<p>
A variety of variables in the <span class="tt">rule</span>
object can be set from in the prologue to specify rule
generation modes or options for the simulator.  These fall into
the following categories.
</p>

<ol class="roman">

    <li><em>StartUp.</em>
        <span class="tt">rule.palreq</span>,
        <span class="tt">rule.patreq</span>,
        and <span class="tt">rule.ocodereq</span>
        allow you to have your rule start by loading a
        <b>.jcc</b> color palette, a <b>.jcp</b> start pattern,
	    and/or a user evaluator (own code) written in
    	JavaScript.
    </li>

    <li><em>Background.</em>
        The <span class="tt">rule.randb</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.randn</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.texthb</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.texthn</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.textvb</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.textvn</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.rseedb</span>,
	    <span class="tt">rule.rseedn</span>, and
	    <span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span>
	    variables control what we call textures of bits that
	    your rule can automatically load into selected planes. 
	    These texture bits are often left invisible.
    </li>

    <li><em>Topology.</em>
	    The <span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> variable
	    specifies whether the screenwrap is to be on, whether
	    you want to consider your rule to be two-dimensional or
	    one-dimensional, and how many bits of how many neighbors
	    are visible to the rule program.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="t1">StartUp</h4>

<p>
<span class="tt">rule.palreq</span> and <span
class="tt">rule.patreq</span> are particularly useful for
creating rules to be shown by self-running demos. If <span
class="tt">rule.palreq</span> and <span
class="tt">rule.patreq</span> are not called in your rule
prologue, the pattern and the color palette left over from the
last rule are used.  If you have just loaded the simulator, the
<b>default.jcc</b> color palette is loaded and the starting
pattern will consist of all zeroes in planes #1 through #7, with
random bits of plane #0 turned on.  This start will be modified
by the rule's texture settings, if any.
</p>

<p>
If a rule requests a <b>.jcc</b>, <b>.jcp</b>, or <b>.js</b>
evaluator file which is not in available on the server, a
warning message appears to let you know the file requested by
the rule could not be found, leaving the previous color palette,
pattern, or no user evaluator in effect.
</p>

<h4 id="t2">Background</h4>

<p>
With <span class="tt">rule.randb</span>, and
<span class="tt">rule.randn</span> we can have random bits fed into
any span of bits that we like. Setting
<span class="tt">rule.randn</span> causes the simulator to randomize
the contents of <span class="tt">rule.randn</span> planes,
starting with plane <span class="tt">rule.randb</span>.  New
random data are stored into the requested planes on each
generation. For example, if you specify
<span class="tt">rule.randb=2; rule.randn=3;</span>, the simulator
will put random bits in planes #2, #3, and #4.  The density of
these random bits will always be 50%, meaning that approximately
half of each randomized plane's cells will be set to 0 and half
to 1.  If you require a randomness of, say, 25% ones, you can
simulate it by filling two planes with random bits and looking
for the cells that have both bits set to 1.  The
<span class="tt">rule.texthb</span>,
<span class="tt">rule.texthn</span>,
<span class="tt">rule.textvb</span>, and
<span class="tt">rule.textvn</span>, variables feed in horizontal and/or
vertical texture. <span class="tt">rule.texthb</span> specifies
the starting plane of the horizontal texture and <span
class="tt">rule.texthn</span> the number of bits of horizontal
texture (0 for none). Similarly,
<span class="tt">rule.textvb</span> specifies the starting plane of
the vertical texture and <span class="tt">rule.textvn</span> the
number of bits of vertical texture (0 for none). If I have one
bit of texture, that means that the texture bit will cycle
between 0 and 1.  If I were to use
<span class="tt">rule.texthb=5;</span> and
<span class="tt">rule.texthn=2;</span> however, I would get two bits
of texture, meaning that the fifth and six bits would cycle
through <span class="ttb">00</span>,
<span class="ttb">01</span>, <span class="ttb">10</span>,
<span class="ttb">11</span>, <span class="ttb">00</span>,
<span class="ttb">01</span>, <span class="ttb">10</span>,
<span class="ttb">11</span>, and so on across the screen. Vertical
texture works the same way, and the combination of horizontal
and vertical can produce a more complicated pattern as in
Sublime.
</p>

<p>
The
<span class="tt">rule.rseedb</span>,
<span class="tt">rule.rseedn</span>, and
<span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span>
variables allow you to start up a rule with random seed bits
in some planes. If you only want some random bits for the startup, but
don't want them to keep coming in later, use
these variables
instead of <span class="tt">rule.randb</span> and
<span class="tt">rule.randn</span>.
<span class="tt">rule.rseedb</span> specifies what plane to
begin random seeding at, and
<span class="tt">rule.rseedn</span> tells it how many planes to
seed (0 for none). In addition,
<span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span> allows you to specify the percentage of ones you want.  (This
is <em>not</em> possible for
random input set by <span class="tt">rule.randb</span> and
<span class="tt">rule.randn</span>,
which always seeds
at 50%.) <span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span> can be set to any value between 0 and 255.
These settings correspond to a percentage of ones which goes from 0%
to 50%.  Thus a setting of 255 means 50% ones and 50% zeroes, while
a setting of 128 means 25% ones and 75% zeroes.
If <span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span> is not set, 255 is used,
generating a seed with 50% ones and 50% zeroes.
</p>

<p>
Thus if I set
<span class="tt">rule.rseedb=2</span>,
<span class="tt">rule.rseedn=1</span>, and
<span class="tt">rule.rseedp=128</span> in my
prologue, then plane #2 will be randomized at the start of
execution of the rule by a pattern that is 25% ones, but it will
not be randomized again.
</p>

<p>
The primary purpose of
<span class="tt">rule.rseedb</span>,
<span class="tt">rule.rseedn</span>, and
<span class="tt">rule.rseedp</span>
is to make it possible to request a start pattern with
randomness in some special planes without having to store the
random information as part of the start pattern. Look at
<a href="rules.html#Soot">Soot</a> or
<a href="rules.html#Dendrite">Dendrite</a> for examples of this.
The reason you don't want to have to store a <b>.jcp</b> file
which has random bits in one of its planes is that then the file
will be about 64K bytes in size, and will take up more space and
download time than you really want to give it.  Because the Soot
pattern gets its &ldquo;random gas&rdquo; from
<span class="tt">rule.rseed</span><em>x</em>,
its <b>.jcp</b> file is only some 2K bytes instead of 64K.
</p>

<p>
When a rule is running, you can see what kinds of texture the rule
requested by looking at the WebCA
<a href="webca.html#rulemodes">Rule Modes</a> dialogue.
</p>

<p>
A special feature of horizontal and vertical textures is that
you can't get rid of them through editing or changing patterns. 
The idea is that if your rule calls for these textures, then it
needs them, so they are put back in every time you leave the map
editor or load a new pattern.  The initial random seed planes
are re-randomized whenever you load a new pattern, but not when
you leave the map editor.
</p>

<h4 id="t3">Topology</h4>

<p>
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> variable specifies three
things: a) Whether your screens wrap around the edges, b)
Whether a rule is two-dimensional or one-dimensional, and c) How
big a neighborhood you want to look at, and how many bits of
each neighbor you want to see.
</p>

<p>
The most commonly used <span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> is 1,
which means a two dimensional
world with wrap turned on. It was actually unnecessary to set
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> to 1 in the Sublime rule, because
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> always defaults to 1. To get a two
dimensional world with the wrap turned off, use
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=0;</span>.
</p>

<p>
If you set <span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> to one of the
values 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9, your rule will act on a
one-dimensional (1D) world.
</p>

<p>
The 1D rules work by first copying each line of the screen onto the
line below it, and by then filling in the top line with a new line
calculated according to the rule function.  This produces a spacetime
trail of the 1D rule, with earlier times appearing lower on the screen
like geological strata.
</p>

<p>
Our simulator is built to suck in eight bits of neighborhood
information.  We allow it to get neighborhood information in
several different ways.  These ways correspond to
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> setting as listed below:
</p>

<p id="Aurora-java">
To give an example of a one-dimensional rule, I give the code
for the rule <b>aurora.js</b> below.
<a href="rules.html#Aurora">Aurora</a> uses two four-bit
neighbors, so we use arguments <span class="tt">l</span> and
<span class="tt">r</span> to reference their four-bit values.
We extract the four-bit value of the cell's own state by ANDing
<span class="tt">oldstate</span> with 15.  This gets the low
four bits out of <span class="tt">oldstate</span> because 15 in
binary is <span class="ttb">00001111</span>, and ANDing any of
the eight bits <em>B</em> in <span class="tt">oldstate</span>
with a 0 produces 0, while ANDing a bit <em>B</em> with a 1
produces <em>B</em>.

</pre>

<p>
In the rule descriptions later in this document I give an
example of a <span class="tt">worldtype</span> 5 rule
(<a href="rules.html#ShortPi">ShortPi</a>) and an example of a
<span class="tt">worldtype</span> 2 rule
(<a href="rules.html#Axons">Axons</a>).
</p>

<p>
Setting <span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> 10 or 11 causes the
simulator to evaluate <em>averaging rules</em>.  These rules
were devised to allow generalizations of the
<a href="rules.html#Rug">Rug</a> rule.  In
both of these modes the screen is wrapped.
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=10;</span> computes the sum of EveryCell's
eight nearest neighbors, and
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=11;</span> gets the sum of EveryCell's four
nearest neighbors.
</p>

<p>
In the averaging rules, the <span class="tt">oldstate</span>
argument passed to the rule function holds the low
five bits of the EveryCell's old eightbit state, the sum of
EveryCell's neighbors is in the argument
<span class="tt">SUM_8</span> (for <span class="tt">rule.worldtype=10;</span>)
or <span class="tt">SUM_4</span>
(for <span class="tt">rule.worldtype=11;</span>). (Eight neighbors in
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=10;</span>, and 4 neighbors in
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=11;</span>.)  This sum can take
as many as eleven bits to write out, which is why we are only
allowed to see five bits of EveryCell's old state.  The
limitation is that our rules use lookup tables whose entries are
indexed by sixteen bit &ldquo;situation&rdquo; codes.
</p>

<p id="Heat-js">
As an example of <span class="tt">rule.worldtype=10;</span>,
here is a program called
<a href="rules.html#Heat">Heat</a>.  A Heat cell takes a straight
average of its neighbor cells, except that if a cell has its low
bit on, the cell's value is kept fixed. The idea is that this
rule is to simulate the heat flow in a metal plate certain of
whose locations are kept fixed at certain temperature values.

rule.worldtype = 10;         // 2D open semitotalistic rule

    var r = 0;

            r = oldstate;

<p>
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=12;</span> and
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=13;</span> are for
&ldquo;user evaluator rules.&rdquo;
Type 12 has wrap turned off, with zero on the boundary; and Type
13 is the torus wrap mode.  To run a rule of
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> 12 or 13, one must have a
predefined user evaluator function. These functions are written
in JavaScript and have extension <b>.js</b>. They are
<a href="ruledef-eval.html">discussed more fully</a> later in this
manual.
</p>

<p id="Rug-java">
The Rug rule below is an example of a rule of this type.  I
could have written a similar Rug rule using
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype=10;</span>,
but I wanted to have the wrap off.  The WebCA Rug rule calls an
evaluator function called <b>semi8</b> which returns the eleven
bit sum of the eight nearest neighbors, so we can use this
function to define a rug rule.
</p>

<pre>
/*

    This program runs an eight cell averaging rule of eight bits
    per cell.  We program it as a nowrap worldtype 12 calling
    the semi8 evaluator.

rule.ocodereq = "semi8";

function rug(lutindex) {
    return ((lutindex &gt;&gt; 3) + 1) &amp; 0xFF;
}
</pre>

<p>
The speed at which the simulator runs depends only on the
<span class="tt">rule.worldtype</span> you have set.  It does not
depend at all on the complexity of the JavaScript rule you write
or on the start pattern you select; it is completely constant. 
Thus, there is no need to make the function that defines the
rule efficient&mdash;it is executed only to create the rule
definition file, then never used again.  The paramount
consideration in writing a rule program is that it be clearly
expressed so that you can come back to it later and still be
able to tell what you were trying to do.
</p>

<p>
<b>.js</b> rule programs are provided for all the WebCA demos. 
A good way to start writing rules of your own is to copy one of
our rules onto your own file <b>first.js</b>.  Then you can edit
<b>first.js</b> to your own purposes, paste it into the rule
program box, and Generate  and run it.  If your rule happens to
return a value for outside the range 0&ndash;255, or supplies
invalid arguments to one of the prologue variables, you will get
an alert when the attempt to generate the rule.  If this
happens, fix your program and try again.
