<h2>Production Notes</h2>

<p>
This edition is a revised edition of the 1997 Third Edition,
which accompanied release of the free version of
<cite>CelLab</cite> including <cite>CelLab</cite> for Windows. 
That edition was a revised and expanded version of the 1989
printed manual which accompanied the first release of this
program.  In the Fourth Edition, documentation of the MS-DOS and
Microsoft Windows versions of the programs (which no longer work
on current Microsoft platforms) has been removed, and replaced
by a description of WebCA, the cellular automata simulator which
runs in a Web browser.  A number of rules, patterns, and
evaluators added since the Third Edition are described.
