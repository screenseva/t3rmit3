<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2 id="t1">What Are Cellular Automata?</h2>

<p>
Cellular automata (CA) are self-generating computer graphics
movies.  The most important near-term application of cellular
automata will be to commercial computer graphics; in five years
you won't be able to watch television for an hour without seeing
some kind of CA.  Three other key applications of cellular
automata will be simulation of biological systems (artificial
life), simulation of physical phenomena (heat-flow and
turbulence), and the design of massively parallel computers.
</p>

<p>
Most of the programs in the Rudy Rucker Cellular Automata Lab
are two-dimensional.  In these programs the
computer screen is divided into &ldquo;cells&rdquo;, which are
colored rectangles or dots.  Each cell is repeatedly
&ldquo;updated&rdquo; by changing its color to a new color. 
The net effect of the individual updates is that you see an
ever-evolving sequence of screens.  A graphics program of this
nature is specifically called a cellular automaton when it is 1)
parallel, 2) local, and 3) homogeneous.
</p>

<p>
(1) <em>Parallelism</em> means that the individual cell updates are
performed independently.  That is, we think of all of
the updates being done at once.  (Strictly speaking, your computer
only updates one cell at a time, but we use a buffer to store the new
cell values until a whole screen's worth has been computed to refresh
the display.)
</p>

<p>
(2) <em>Locality</em> means that when a cell is updated, its new
color value is based solely on the old color values of the cell and of
its nearest neighbors.
</p>

<p>
(3) <em>Homogeneity</em> means that all cells are updated according
to the same rules.  Typically the color values of the cell and of its
nearest eight neighbors are combined according to some
logico-algebraic formula, or are used to locate an entry in a preset
lookup table.
</p>

<p>
Cellular automata can act as good models for physical,
biological and sociological phenomena because
each person, or cell, or small region of space
&ldquo;updates&rdquo; itself independently (parallelism), basing
its new state on the appearance of its immediate surroundings
(locality) and on some generally shared laws of change
(homogeneity).
</p>

<p>
As a simple example of a physical CA, imagine sitting at the
edge of a swimming pool, stirring the water with your feet.  Notice how
quickly the pool's surface is updated.  The
&ldquo;computation&rdquo; is so fast because it is parallel: all
the water molecules are computing at once.  And how does a
molecule compute? It reacts to forces from its neighbors
(locality), in accordance with the laws of physics
(homogeneity).

<h2 id="t2">Overview</h2>

<p>
<cite>CelLab</cite> consists of a high-performance cellular
automata simulator, <a href="webca.html">WebCA</a>, which runs in
your Web browser (a modern browser that supports HTML5 and
JavaScript is required), a collection of pre-defined rules,
patterns, and color palettes which let you perform a variety of
experiments with cellular automata, and tools that allow you
to invent and test your own rules, using either the JavaScript
language built into your Web browser or a Java language development
environment installed on your computer.  Instructions and tools
for creating custom patterns, color palettes, user evaluators
(which allow extending the environments WebCA can simulate),
and scripted demonstrations are available.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.rudyrucker.com/">Rudy Rucker</a>, the author
of thirty books of science-fiction, popular science and
mathematics, and computing, is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics
and Computer Science at San Jose State University.

</p>

<h2 id="i1-INTRO-webcademo">Demonstration of WebCA</h2>

<p>
To give an overview of the kinds of things you'll see as you
explore the world of cellular automata, you might start out by
viewing a completely automatic demonstration of the various
rules we'll be discussing, run in WebCA.
</p>

<h3 class="c"><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/?show=demo"
    rel="Target:CelLabRunRule">Run the demo</a></h3>

<p>
The demo shows you a festival of one-act cellular automata plays.  In
each case, you are watching an actual rule running; you are not
watching a prerecorded movie or series of slides.
The individual rules are <a href="rules.html">described in detail</a>
later in this manual.  The demo is an example of a WebCA
&ldquo;show&rdquo;.  Later, you'll learn how to
<a href="webca.html#defshows">create your own shows</a>.
</p>

<p>
How can you take over the control of WebCA for yourself?
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/cellab/webca/"
    rel="Target:CelLabRunRule">Launch WebCA</a>
in a Web browser window.  It's best if you open it in a new
window so you can use it while you work through this document.
Now, to load a rule, click the drop-down list on the &ldquo;Rule
URL&rdquo; line below the map display. Choose one of the
standard rules&mdash;let's start with
&ldquo;<b><a href="rules.html#Brain">Brain</a></b>&rdquo;.  Press the
&ldquo;Start&rdquo; button to set the rule running.  You can
flip back and forth between running and pausing by pressing the
button, or run the rule one generation at a time by pressing
&ldquo;Step&rdquo; repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
I think it's safe to say that WebCA is the fastest all-software
high-resolution cellular automaton simulator in existence. 
Notice all the little creaturelets crawling around in Brain. 
WebCA's Brain is a digital antfarm.  While Brain is running, try
rerandomizing the screen by pressing the &ldquo;Random&rdquo;
button in the &ldquo;Pattern&rdquo; line.  Then pause the
simulation and try loading a pattern from the drop-down list in
the &ldquo;Pattern URL&rdquo; line.  How about <b>Bigant</b>? 
The pattern will appear and then be deconstructed by the running
Brain rule when you press &ldquo;Start&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
You should see the Brain rule eat the cyberspace ant. If you
don't like the &ldquo;<b>Bigant</b>&rdquo;, you can use Tim
Leary's face, stored as &ldquo;<b>Tim</b>&rdquo;.  Since Brain
wipes patterns out so quickly, let's try loading a different
rule with a pattern.  Let's feed Tim to Vote, to smooth him out,
and then let's give him to Votedna to fatten up his contours.
</p>

<p>
Pause the simulation, then choose the Tim pattern from the
drop-down list on the &ldquo;Pattern URL&rdquo; line.  Now use
the drop-down list on the &ldquo;Rule URL&rdquo; line to select
the &ldquo;<b><a href="rules.html#Vote">Vote</a></b>&rdquo; rule. 
Press &ldquo;Start&rdquo;, let it run for a short while, then
press &ldquo;Pause&rdquo; (the same button). Now choose the
&ldquo;<b><a href="rules.html##i3-CA-votedna">VoteDNA</a></b>&rdquo; rule
from the Rule drop-down list and press &ldquo;Start&rdquo; to
resume.
</p>

<p>
VoteDNA is a nice rule.  Press the &ldquo;Random&rdquo; button
and watch how it makes strings out of random crud.  Pause the
simulation again, randomize one more time, and load the
&ldquo;<b><a href="rules.html#Hodge">Hodge</a></b>&rdquo; rule.  Then bring
back the Tim pattern and watch him turn into living paisley.
</p>

<p>
For a last demo, load another rule, the &ldquo;reversible&rdquo;
rule called <a href="rules.html#TimeTun">TimeTun</a>.
TimeTun starts with a standard pattern (another ant&mdash;what
<em>is it</em> with these guys and ants, anyway?).
</p>

<p>
To apply the rule to the pattern for a single step, press
&ldquo;Step&rdquo;.  The pattern will change, growing outward
and becoming more colorful.  Press &ldquo;Step&rdquo; a few more
times and observe the growth.  Now let the automaton run on its
own by pressing &ldquo;Start&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Before long the screen will look less like a hard-edged computer
display and more like something from the 1960's, usually
generated without recourse to computer hardware.  Now press the
&ldquo;Swap&rdquo; button below the &ldquo;Pattern URL&rdquo;
line. Watch it run for awhile and something truly remarkable
will happen.
</p>

<p class="c">
<img src="figures/fig3.png" width="640" height="400" alt="" />
<br />
<em>The TimeTun rule after 195 generations.</em>
</p>

<p>
Go ahead and try a variety of rules and patterns.  All of the
rules from the demo are here.  One thing to keep in mind is that
many of our demo rules will forcibly load a standard startup
pattern, so if you want to give them a different pattern, you
have to load the pattern after the rule.
</p>

<h2 id="t4">Why Cellular Automata?  Rudy's Answer</h2>

<p>
The remarkable thing about CAs is their ability to produce
interesting and logically deep patterns on the basis of very
simply stated preconditions.  Just as the Mandelbrot set arises
from the repeated iteration of the simple equation
<i>Z</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<i>Z</i>&sup2;&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>C</i>,
iterating the steps of a CA computation can produce fabulously
rich output.  A good CA is like an acorn which grows an oak
tree, or more accurately, a good CA is like the DNA inside the
acorn, busily orchestrating the protein nanotechnology that
builds the tree.
</p>

<p>
I feel that science's greatest task in the late twentieth
century is to build living machines: <em>intelligent artificial
life</em>, known as <em>a-life</em> for short.  In Cambridge,
Los Alamos, Silicon Valley and beyond, this is the computer
scientist's Great Work as surely as the building of the
N&ocirc;tre Dame cathedral on the Ile de France was the Great
Work of the medieval artisan.
</p>

<p>
There are two approaches to the problem of creating
<em>a-life</em>: the top/down approach, and the bottom/up
approach.
</p>

<p>
The top/down approach is associated with AI (artificial
intelligence), the bottom/up with CA (the study of cellular
automata).  Both approaches are needed for intelligent
artificial life, and I predict that someday soon chaos theory,
neural nets and fractal mathematics will provide a bridge
between the two.  What a day that will be when our machines
begin to live and speak and breed&mdash;a day like May 10, 1869,
when the final golden spike completed the U.S. transcontinental
railroad! The study of CAs brings us ever closer to the forging
of that last golden link in the great chain between bottom and
beyond.  If all goes well, many of us will see live robot
boppers on the Moon.
</p>

<p>
A heckler might say, &ldquo;Sure that's fine, but why are CAs
needed? Why have a bottom/up approach at all? What do mindless
colored dots have to do with intelligent artificial life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For all humanity's spiritual pretensions, we need matter to live
on. And CAs can act as the &ldquo;matter&rdquo; on which
intelligent life can evolve. CAs provide a lively, chaotic
substrate capable of supporting the most diverse emergent
behaviors.  Indeed, it is at least possible that human life
itself is quite literally based on CAs.
</p>

<p>
How so?  View a person as wetware: as a protein factory.  The
proteins flip about like John Holland's genetic programs or like
A. K. Dewdney's flibs; generating hormones, storing memories. 
Looking deeper, observe that the proteins' nanotech churning is
a pattern made up of flows and undulations in the potential
surfaces of quantum chemistry.  These surfaces &ldquo;smell
out&ldquo; minimal energy configurations by using the fine fuzz
of physical vacuum noise&mdash;far from being like smooth rubber
sheets, they are like pocked ocean swells in a rainstorm.  The
quantum noise obeys local rules that are quite mathematical; and
these rules are in fact very well simulated by CAs.
</p>

<p>
Why is it that CAs are so good at simulating physics? Because, just as
in physics, cellular automaton computations are i) parallel, ii)
local, and iii) homogeneous.  In both physics and in CAs, i) the world
is happening in many different places at once, ii) there is no action
at a distance,<a href="footnote.html#F1_1"><img
    class="foot" src="icons/footnote.png"
    height="16" width="16" alt="[Footnote]" /></a>
and iii) the laws of nature are the same everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not the physical world really is a cellular
automaton, the point is that CAs are rich enough that a
&ldquo;biological&rdquo; world could live on them.  We human
hackers live on language games on biology on chemistry on
physics on mathematics on-something very like the iterated
parallel computations of a CA.  Life needs something to live on,
intelligence needs something to think on, and it is this
seething information matrix which CAs can provide.  If AI is the
surfer, CA is the sea.
</p>

<p>
That's why I think cellular automata are interesting: A-life!  CAs will
lead to intelligent artificial life!
</p>

<p>
Rudimentary CA a-life already exists in the form of Brain's
haulers, Vote's oscillators, and such classic Life patterns
as Gosper's glider gun.
</p>

<p>
In the 1970s, Berlenkamp, Conway, and Guy
proved that putting a lot of these objects together can make a
universal serial computer, such as a PC.  Any serial computation can
be done by a CA, and any CA computation can in turn be done by a
serial computer&mdash;in support of this last point, note that all of our
programs are serial programs written in JavaScript or Java.
</p>

<p>
Many computations can be done much more rapidly and efficiently by a
succession of massively parallel CA steps.  And one does best to use
the CA intrinsically, rather than simply using it as a simulation of
the old serial mode&mdash;emulating an Intel chip by using a galaxy-sized
array of blocks and glider guns is not the way to go.  No, when we use
CAs best, we do not use them as limpware animations of circuit
diagrams.  While behaviors can be found in top-down expert-system
style by harnessing particular patterns to particular purposes, I
think by far the more fruitful course is to use the bottom/up
freestyle surfing CA style summed up in the slogan:
</p>

<p class="c">
<b>Seek Ye The Gnarl!</b>
</p>

<p>
New dimensional CA hacks are possible, new and marketable techniques
of parallel programming are lying around waiting to be found, both in
the form of individual CA structures and in the form of wholly
different rules.
</p>

<p>
CA structures are labile and breedable in three senses: one can
collide and interface different local patterns within the
framework of a fixed CA rule, one can combine globally different
CA rules (or ideas about them) to produce wholly new ecologies,
or one can &ldquo;gene-splice&rdquo; the logic of successful
rules.  Then, like Alexander von Humboldt in the Americas, one
botanizes and zoologizes and mineralizes, looking for whatever
artificially alive information structures can be found in the
new worlds.  As always both top/down and bottom/up approaches
are viable.  We use bottom/up to find new ecologies and their
flora and fauna.  We use top/down to seed a given instance of a
particular ecology with the sort of gene-tailored computer
agents we want to breed.
</p>

<p>
In my own bottom/up searches I begin simply by hoping that my
programs will display interesting output for a long time.  Then
I begin to hope that my programs will be robust under varying
initial conditions, and that they will be reactive in
anthropomorphizable ways.  Once the program is, at this very
rudimentary level, artificially alive, I may cast about for
applications in some practical domain.
</p>

<p>
I think the most productive near-term applications of CAs are to
image generation and image processing.  A cycle or two of Vote,
for instance, can be used for easy image cleanup, munching down
all stray &ldquo;turd bits&rdquo;.  This technique, known as
&ldquo;convolution&rdquo; in the literature, is used every day
by NASA's massively parallel computer in Beltsville, Maryland,
to process terabyte arrays of satellite photo data.  Present-day
designers of the newest commercial paint and graphics packages
for the VGA will be putting CA rules into their image processor
toolboxes.  (Look, for instance, at what Border does to Dr.
Tim's face.)
</p>

<p>
In the area of original image generation, I predict that one of
the next big commercial computer graphics fads will be CAs.  How
about a logo that instead of being chrome is matte and luminous,
with a smooth curved surface made of tiny moving mosaics of
light, lightbits that form the crawling dirty haulers of Brain
or the psychedelic shudder of Rug? These are what the expressive
&ldquo;flickercladding&rdquo; skins of the robots look like in my
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1607012111/?tag=fourmilabwwwfour">a-life
science fiction novels</a>, <cite>Software</cite> and
<cite>Wetware</cite>.
</p>

<p>
Many simulation applications exist as well.  The idea is to find
a CA rule that looks like something you want to model.  If you
are lucky there will be some common underlying mathematics
between the two.  The Rug rules, for instance, are difference
method solutions of the same differential equation, the
Laplacian heat equation:
</p>

<p class="c">
<img src="figures/eq-1-1.png"
    alt="(d&sup2;Q/dx&sup2; + d&sup2;Q/dy&sup2;) = 0"
    width="169" height="59" />
</p>

<p>
This means, e.g., that a fine-grained Rug rule inside a fixed
circular boundary set may serve as a viable model of a vibrating
drumhead!
</p>

<p>
A last current application of CAs is to encryption. Either a CA
can serve as a cheap source of &ldquo;essentially random&rdquo;
encryption bits, or the whole message can be fed to a reversible
CA. Stephen Wolfram claims actually to have patented the
one-dimensional rule with Wolfram code #30 as part of an
encryption scheme.<a href="footnote.html#F1_2"><img
    class="foot"
    src="icons/footnote.png" height="16" width="16" alt="[Footnote]" /></a>
</p>

<p>
But to recapitulate, <em>the real reason for studying CAs is to
promote artificial life</em>.  The most important use for
cellular automata will be as &ldquo;universes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;arenas&rdquo; in which to evolve better fractals, flibs,
core-warriors, neural nets and expert agents, using
gene-splicing, mutation, and our own &ldquo;divine interventions&rdquo; to
achieve a rapid and dramatic evolution in these parallel
processes.  CA workers need your help in accomplishing the
manifest destiny of mankind: to pass the torch of life and
intelligence on to the computer.  There are no more than a few
hundred active workers in the CA field today<a href="footnote.html#F1_3"><img
    class="foot"
    src="icons/footnote.png" height="16" width="16" alt="[Footnote]" /></a>
<em>twenty-first century technology will need thousands more!</em>
</p>

<h2 id="t5">Why Cellular Automata?  John's Answer (by John Walker)</h2>

<p>
Physics is local.  The two great pillars of Twentieth Century
science, general relativity and quantum mechanics, can be viewed
as supplanting the mysticism of &ldquo;action at a
distance&rdquo; and &ldquo;force fields,&rdquo; by such mundane,
self-evident, and intuitive mechanisms as the Riemann curvature
tensor, virtual gluons, and the Higgs field.  Both of these
theories describing the universe in the large and the very small
(albeit in mathematically incompatible ways), tell us that all
the complex fabric of events we observe are consequences of
individual particles locally responding to conditions directly
affecting them, whether moving along geodesics in curved
spacetime or undergoing interactions through particle exchange. 
Both theories have withstood all experimental tests to date,
including many thought impossible when they were originally
propounded.
</p>

<p>
A cellular automaton (CA) is a mechanism for modeling systems with
local interactions.  A cellular automaton is a regular lattice of
cells with local state, which interact with their neighbors subject to
a uniform rule which governs all cells.  The neighborhood (the set of
cells whose state can affect a given cell at one instant) can be
classified by the dimensionality of the automaton (most
experimentation is done with one- or two-dimensional automata), and by
the geometric fashion in which cells are interconnected.
</p>

<p>
The rule is the &ldquo;program&rdquo; that governs the behavior
of the system. All cells apply the rule, over and over, and it
is the recursive application of the rule that leads to the
remarkable behavior exhibited by many cellular automata.  When
experimenting with cellular automata, one is primarily engaged
in defining new rules which lead to interesting or useful
behavior.  <cite>CelLab</cite> provides tools for the person engaged
in such experiments.  It allows you to create a rich set of
rules and experiment with their behavior without requiring the
purchase of expensive special-purpose hardware.
</p>

<p>
Cellular automata appear to be abstract and devoid of practical
applications, much as was said of computer graphics not long
ago.  If you want to model a universe which seems to be made up
of particles which interact locally, there are two basic ways to
go about it.  The first is to create a huge array of numbers
that represents the interacting items, then find the biggest
number cruncher you can lay your hands on and set it gnawing
away at the problem.  The supercomputer boom, fueled by
applications of this approach to weather prediction,
computational fluid dynamics in the transonic and hypersonic
regimes, plasma dynamics, and an almost endless list of other
applications testifies to the effectiveness of this approach.
</p>

<p>
But maybe there's another way.  Until recently, cellular
automata were primarily a theoretical tool.  The price of a
cellular automaton with uniform edge size increases as the
<em>n</em>th power of its size, where <em>n</em> is the
dimensionality of the cellular automaton.  This gets out of hand
rapidly, even if you're only working with two dimensional
cellular automata.  Therefore, although they may be the way the
universe is really assembled and therefore worthy of study, no
one would consider building one!
</p>

<p>
Hardware realizations of cellular automata, such as the CAM-6
board, have been built.  The CAM-6 is not a true cellular
system; it emulates one by using a fast RAM array and a look-up
table, but it permits exploration of a rich set of cellular
automata with performance adequate to study their behavior in
detail.  The CAM-6 is a highly effective tool, but it is, at
$1,500, an expensive one.  It's priced out of the reach of many
creative people who should be exploring cellular automata.  It
was the desire to make cellular automata experimentation
available at a low price to a large number of people that
spurred the development of this product.
</p>

<p>
For cellular automata need only to find a concrete, compelling
application to a real-world problem to burst into silicon and
totally change the way we think about computing.  Consider this:
inside the computer you're using now are ranks and ranks of RAM
chips.  A 256K&times;1 static RAM chip has a memory cell
consisting of four to six transistors, connected in rows and
columns to circuitry on the periphery of the chip.  Even when
the computer is running flat-out, you're using precisely one
cell at a time.  This is the classic bottleneck in the von
Neumann computer architecture (John von Neumann was very aware
of this problem; in fact, he and Stanislaw Ulam
<em>invented</em> cellular automata precisely as a tool for
modeling complex systems), which has led to proposals such as
Backus' functional programming, neural systems, and many other
architectural proposals, such as SIMD machines, which seem to be
more effective in generating Ph.D.s than numbers.
</p>

<p>
If a two-dimensional cellular automaton with 256K cells were
realized in silicon, it could compute 262,144 times faster than
a serial processor accessing data bit-by-bit from a memory
array.  Yet, engineered for volume production, made in
comparable volumes, and given time to slide down the learning
curve, it need cost no more than a RAM chip.  This is the
potential of cellular automata.  The beauty of two-dimensional
cellular automata is that they map perfectly into our
semiconductor manufacturing technology: they need the things it
does best as opposed to, say, neural systems where the number of
connections exceeds the capability of two layers of metal.
</p>

<p>
If there is merit in Edward Fredkin's suggestion
that the fine-grained structure of the universe is really a cellular
automaton, then cellular automata machines will play the role of
particle accelerators in exploring this level of reality.
</p>

<p>
Some of the brightest minds of our century have been involved
with cellular automata because they comprehended what cellular
automata can do.  John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, John Horton
Conway, Stephen Wolfram, and Edward Fredkin do not spend their
time on nonsense.  With the Rudy Rucker <cite>CelLab</cite>, you
can begin to explore the potential that attracted those men to
create and research this new way to compute.  And perhaps you
will discover something that will add your name to the list.
</p>

<p class="subsuper">
There's plenty to discover.  <cite>CelLab</cite> lets you
program 256<sup>2<sup>16</sup></sup> distinct CA rules, which is
a number larger than 10<sup>157,826</sup>.  These numbers are
&ldquo;effectively infinite&rdquo;.  Roughly 10<sup>17</sup> seconds are
thought to have elapsed since the big bang ushered in the
universe.  If you had been around since then, creating, testing,
and evaluating one rule per second, you still wouldn't have made
a dent in this number, any more than a buck makes a dent in a
trillion dollars.  Take away one dollar and you still have about
a trillion.  Even with enough time, you'd have a lot of trouble
writing down the results of your exhaustive search for rules, as
the universe is believed only to have on the order of
10<sup>80</sup> particles in it, so you'd run out of places to
make notes even if you turned the entire universe into a cosmic
all-encompassing Post-it&reg; note.  If the still-unconfirmed
Grand Unified Theories are correct, by the time 10<sup>40</sup>
seconds have passed, more than half of the protons will have
evaporated into little poofs of energy and leptons, taking with
them the fruits of your labors, and leaving what's left of you
with 10<sup>157,826</sup> bottles of beer still on the wall.
</p>

<p>
So get started, people!  The human mind works a lot better than
blind search (one imagines a middle manager reporting,
&ldquo;Nothing much yet&mdash;we need more monkeys, more
typewriters.&rdquo;).  <cite>CelLab</cite> unleashes your creativity
in a virtually infinite domain, where your discoveries may be
not only interesting or rewarding, but may create a whole new
world.  The challenges in cellular automata are clear: how to
realize them in hardware, how to apply them to useful tasks, and
how to make money doing it.  You now possess a tool for
exploring all three.
</p>

<h2 id="t6">A Sampler of CA Applications</h2>

<p>
The main applications of cellular automata are to:
