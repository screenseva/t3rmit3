<h1>File Formats</h1>

<p>
Note: this information is believed accurate as of the time of
the release of <cite>CelLab</cite>.  It describes internal file
formats read and written by the program which are not normally
manipulated by user programs.  These file formats are subject to
change in future releases of <cite>CelLab</cite>.  If you
develop programs that manipulate <cite>CelLab</cite> files based
on this information, please be aware that you may have to modify
your programs to work with future releases of
<cite>CelLab</cite>.
</p>

<p>
This information is for experienced systems programmers; as long
as you use <cite>CelLab</cite> and its associated tools, you
don't need to worry about its file formats.  This information is
provided in case you want to interface <cite>CelLab</cite> to
other software via its files.  We can't help you debug programs
you develop based on this information, but dumping files written
in these formats with your debugger should help resolve any
problems.
</p>

<p>
That said, onward to the gory details!
</p>

<h2>PATTERN FILES</h2>

<p>
Pattern files can be written either in ASCII or binary format.
Each format can be written either compressed or uncompressed.
All pattern files are written with an extension of
<b>.jcp</b>&mdash;the format is determined by examining the
bytes at the beginning of the file.  All formats represent a
pattern map consisting of 200 lines, each containing 322 bytes.
Within each line the first and last bytes are used internally
within <cite>CelLab</cite>, do not appear on the screen, and can
be ignored (they're saved in the pattern file because it's
faster to dump uncompressed binary files with them included).
Pattern files represent a total of 64,400 bytes (322&times;200),
stored in various forms.  The top line on the screen appears
first in the pattern file and the the bottom line last.  Bytes
within each line are written with the leftmost pixel on the
screen first and the rightmost pixel last (surrounded, of
course, by the two extra bytes).
</p>

<h3 id="PatASCII">ASCII Pattern Files</h3>

<p>
ASCII pattern files are primarily intended for interchange
with programming languages which cannot readily process binary files.
ASCII files always consume more disk space than their binary
equivalent and take longer to load and save.
</p>

<h4>Uncompressed ASCII Pattern Files</h4>

<p>
An uncompressed ASCII pattern file consists simply of a total of
64,400 hexadecimal numbers, separated by spaces.  Line breaks
are inserted to limit the length of lines to less than 80
characters and an extra line break is inserted at the end of
each of the 200 screen lines.  The hexadecimal numbers are
written in without leading zeroes or other number format flags.
Numbers from uncompressed pattern files can be read directly
with a C format string of
&ldquo;<span class="tt">%x</span>&rdquo;.  Uncompressed ASCII
pattern files are huge and take forever to read and write, but
they're the easiest format to decode.  Here are the first two
lines of an uncompressed ASCII pattern file representing a
random map:
</p>

<pre>
0 A1 92 F5 C7 F9 DC D 36 8 1B C6 AB 78 42 A BA CE 5E EE FA F7 3F 4E C8
B6 6F A2 7D AA 7E BE AB 61 94 2 46 8E 23 8B 1 6 B3 32 A3 F0 A5 7 34 81
</pre>

<h4>Compressed ASCII Pattern Files</h4>

<p>
Compressed ASCII pattern files are run length encoded&mdash;they
consist of a sequence of space-separated pairs of numbers: the
numbers separated by a comma.  The first number gives, in
decimal, the number of consecutive occurrences of the value
given, in hexadecimal, by the second number.  New line
characters are inserted to keep line lengths below 80
characters.  Data in the pattern map may be compressed across
lines.  The first character of a compressed ASCII pattern file
is always an asterisk; this identifies it as a pattern file.
The following is a compressed pattern file representing a single
dot with state 237 (which in hexadecimal is 0xED):
</p>

<pre>
*32684,0 1,ED 31715,0
</pre>

<p>
Note that the numbers total to 64,400, the total number of bytes in
the map.
</p>

<h3 id="PatBinary">Binary Pattern Files</h3>

<p>
Data bytes in binary pattern files are written in the internal
format used within <cite>CelLab</cite>.  Bytes within
<cite>CelLab</cite> are rotated one bit to the right so that the
bit representing Plane 0 appears as the most significant bit of
each byte.  When you read or write a binary pattern map, you'll
have to compensate for this by rotating the data one bit to the
left before interpreting it as a normal state code.
</p>

<p>
All binary pattern files have an ASCII colon
&ldquo;<span class="tt">:</span>&rdquo; (hexadecimal code 3A) as the first
byte.  The colon is followed by one or more instructions as
defined in the following table.  The end of the binary pattern
file is marked by the appearance of an RLEND instruction (byte
with value 6).  The instruction codes and count bytes that
follow the instruction are not rotated&mdash;only value bytes
representing cell states are rotated one bit.
</p>

<pre>
        RLUNCOMP = 1      64K of uncompressed data follows
        RLRUN    = 2      2-257 byte run of value follows
        RLONEB   = 3      Single byte of specified value follows
        RLUNCS   = 4      Uncompressed stream follows
        RLEND    = 6      End of pattern
        RLLRUN   = 7      Long run &gt; 256 bytes
        RLLUNCS  = 8      Long uncompressed stream &gt; 256 bytes
</pre>

<h4>Uncompressed Binary Pattern Files</h4>

<p>
Uncompressed binary pattern files consist of the initial colon, an
RLUNCOMP instruction (code 1), followed by 64,400 bytes of pattern map
data (each byte rotated one bit to the right, as noted above),
followed by an RLEND (code 6) instruction.  Since pattern maps can be
loaded and dumped directly from the map with one I/O call,
uncompressed binary pattern files can be read and written very
quickly.
</p>

<h4 id="PatBinComp">Compressed Binary Pattern Files</h4>

<p>
Compressed binary pattern files begin with the colon and end with an
RLEND instruction.  The data between these two bytes is a series of
instructions representing the data in run length compressed form.  The
interpretation of each instruction and the bytes that follow it is as
given below:
</p>

<dl class="justified">
    <dt>RLRUN <em>Count Value</em></dt>
        <dd>Store <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 bytes of
                   <em>Value</em> in the next consecutive cells
                   of the map buffer.</dd>

    <dt>RLLRUN <em>CountHi CountLow Value</em></dt>
        <dd>Compute <em>Count</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;((<em>CountHi</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;256)
                   + <em>CountLow</em>),  then  store
                   <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 bytes of
                   <em>Value</em> in the next consecutive cells
                   of the map buffer.</dd>

    <dt>RLONEB <em>Value</em></dt>
        <dd>Store <em>Value</em> in the next cell of the map buffer.</dd>

    <dt>RLUNCS <em>Count Value[1] Value[2] ... Value[Count+1]</em></dt>
        <dd>Store the  <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 bytes
                   specified by the <em>Value[n]</em> bytes in
                   the next cells of the map buffer.</dd>

    <dt>RLLUNCS <em>CountHi CountLow Value[1] Value[2] &hellip; Value[Count+1]</em></dt>
        <dd>Compute <em>Count</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;((<em>CountHi</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;256)
                   + <em>CountLow</em>), then store the
                   <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 bytes specified
                   by the <em>Value[n]</em> bytes in the next
                   cells of the map buffer.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>COLOR PALETTE FILES</h2>

<p>
Color palette files can be written in ASCII or binary form.  All
have the default extension of <b>.jcc</b>; the format is
determined from the contents of the file.  When working with
color palettes, the standard pattern <b>chroma.jcp</b> can be
useful; it shows you all of the states in the palette, from 0 to
255, in a 16&times;16 grid of squares, with states reading from
left to right, then top to down.  Blocks of 8 squares are
separated by extra space for easier interpretation.  You can
load this pattern from the drop-down list in the Pattern URL
line of the WebCA control panel.
</p>

<h3 id="PalASCII">ASCII Color Palette Files</h3>

<p>
ASCII color palette files have a very simple format; they are easy to
generate manually or programmatically for custom representation of
states.  The format is as follows.
</p>

<p>
The first line contains a single number, the format indicator, which
can be 2, 3, or 5.  Values signify:
</p>

<pre>
        2     VGA Palette file
        3     Composite (CGA and VGA) palette file
        5     RGB Palette file (0&ndash;255 intensity)
</pre>

<p>
This line is followed by up to 256 lines specifying color
assignments for states.  If fewer than 256 lines follow the
format indicator, the color assignments for those states will be
left as before.  Each line of a VGA palette file specifies the
red, green, and blue intensities from 0 to 63, separated by
spaces, for each state.  A composite file supplies both CGA and
VGA values for each state with the VGA red, green, and blue
intensities followed by the CGA color index for the state.  The
CGA color index was used by earlier versions of
<cite>CelLab</cite> and is now ignored. RGB palette files are
the same as VGA palette files except that intensities of the
red, green, and blue components run from 0 to 255.
</p>

<h3 id="PalProc">Procedural Color Palette Files</h3>

<p>
Procedural color palette files allow a compact textual
specification of complex color palettes for rules which
employ &ldquo;housekeeping bits&rdquo; in their states
which you don't want to affect the display of the map.
For example, our <a href="rules.html#PerfumeT">Perfume</a>
rules use two bit planes to represent the gas and containers,
but six other planes for internal information.  Crafting
a palette which displays only the relevant information
while excluding the other planes can be tedious and
prone to error.  A procedural palette can get the job
done in just a few lines.
</p>

<p>
A procedural palette file begins with a line containing
the number &ldquo;7&rdquo;; this indicates it is in
procedural form.  Subsequent lines are statements as
follows.  Blank lines and any material after two slashes
(&ldquo;<span class="tt">//</span>&rdquo;) is ignored and
may be used for comments.
</p>

<blockquote>
<dl class="jb">
    <dt>mask <em>number</em></dt>
    <dd>Mask the physical states by ANDing with <em>number</em>.
        The number is assumed to be in decimal, or hexadecimal
        if it begins with
        &ldquo;<span class="tt">0x</span>&rdquo;.
        If no mask is specified,
        <span class="tt">0xFF</span> is assumed.  Only one
        <span class="tt">mask</span> should be specified; if
        the palette contains more than one, the last mask will
        be used.</dd>
        
    <dt>state <em>statelist</em> <em>color</em>[-<em>color</em>]</dt>
    <dd>The CSS <em>color</em> specification is assigned to the states
        in <em>statelist</em>, which is a comma separated list of states,
        each of which can be a number (again, hexadecimal
        if preceded by &ldquo;<span class="tt">0x</span>&rdquo;),
        or a range separated by a hyphen, with an optional
        increment also preceded by a hyphen.
        &ldquo;<span class="tt">state</span>&rdquo; may be
        abbreviated to
        &ldquo;<span class="tt">s</span>&rdquo;.  If
        multiple assignments are made to the same state,
        the last will be used.  If a second color is given,
        separated by a hyphen from the first, the states
        in <em>statelist</em> will be filled with a
        linear gradient starting with the first color and
        ending with the second.</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, the following is a complete procedural palette
file for the Perfume rules.
</p>

<pre>
    7   //  Procedural palette for the Perfume rules
    mask 6
    state 0 black               // Color name
    s 2 #0000FF                 // Hex RGB specfication
    state 4,6 rgb(255, 255, 0)  // Decimal RGB
</pre>

<p>
You can specify any number of states and ranges on a
&ldquo;<span class="tt">state</span>&rdquo; declaration:
</p>

<pre>
    state 2,3,7-12,0x19-0x21,128-252-4 hsl(120, 60%, 70%)
</pre>

<p>
It is permissible to replace the color assignment to a
state in a subsequent statement.  This is handy in
cases where you want to specify exceptions to a large
range.  The following sets all states to grey, then
assigns different colors to a few states in the range.
</p>

<pre>
    state 0-255 grey
    state 1 red
    state 17 skyblue
    state 63-95 yellow-blue
</pre>

<h3 id="PalBinary">Binary Color Palette Files</h3>

<p>
Binary color palette files are all precisely 771 bytes long. The
first three bytes are an ASCII format code of &ldquo;4&rdquo;
(code 34 hex) or &ldquo;6&rdquo; (code 36 hex), a carriage
return (0D hex), and a line feed (code 0A hex).  This prologue,
which identifies the file as being binary format, is followed by
768 bytes, with consecutive triples of bytes specifying the
color assignments for the 256 state codes from 0 to 255
(768&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;256).  If the format code
is &ldquo;4&rdquo;, the three bytes in each triple specify the
red, green, and blue intensities from 0 through 63.  The first
byte of each triple also may contain, in its two most
significant bits, a legacy color index assignment for the state,
from 0 to 3, which is ignored by WebCA.  If the format code is
&ldquo;6&rdquo;, the three bytes of the triple give red, green,
and blue intensities from 0 to 255.
</p>


<h2>RULE DEFINITION FILES</h2>

<p>
<cite>CelLab</cite> evaluates cellular automata rules by table
look-up.  The basic content of a rule definition (<b>.jc</b>)
file is the values to be loaded into the lookup table to define
the rule.  Rule definitions may also set numerous modes that
affect the operation of <cite>CelLab</cite>, request the loading
of patterns, color palettes, and the like.
</p>

<p>
Rule definition files are always binary files.  They consist
of a sequence of instruction codes, each followed by data specific to
that instruction.  The methods and instruction codes used in rule
definition files are a very similar to those used in compressed binary
pattern files.  The instruction codes used in rule definition files
are as follows:
</p>

<p>
<b>Rule lookup table compression instructions:</b>
</p>

<pre>
        RLUNCOMP = 1      64K of uncompressed rule follows
        RLRUN    = 2      2-257 byte run of value follows
        RLONEB   = 3      Single byte of specified value follows
        RLUNCS   = 4      Uncompressed stream follows
        RLCOPYB  = 5      Copy previously specified bank
        RLEND    = 6      End of rule definition, parameters
</pre>

<p>
<b>Rule mode request instructions:</b>
</p>

<pre>
        RSHTEXT  = 64     Horizontal texture request
        RSVTEXT  = 65     Vertical texture request
        RSRAND   = 66     Random stimulus request
        RSPAT    = 67     Pattern load request
        RSPAL    = 68     Palette load request
        RSEPAT   = 69     Embedded palette address
        RSEPAL   = 70     Embedded pattern address
        RSRSEED  = 71     Initial random seed
        RSOCODE  = 72     Own code load request
        RSEOCODE = 73     Embedded own code address
</pre>

<p>
The lookup table always consists of 65,536 bytes of data (even
though many rules do not need or use the entire table), and a
rule definition file always loads every byte of the table.  Each
byte in the table represents a the new state for a cell when its
state and that of its neighbors select that cell in the rule
lookup table.  The cell states in the lookup tables are stored
in the internal format with Plane 0 as the most significant bit
and Planes 1 through 7 as the least significant 7 bits (in other
words, the states are rotated circularly one bit to the right).
The relationship between the values of the neighbors and the
lookup table indices for the various settings of worldtype can
be seen by examining the JavaScript or Java rule generation
code in the source code supplied with <cite>CelLab</cite>.
</p>

<p>
The compression algorithms used keep the size of rule files
commensurate with the actual data needed by the rule.  First, let's
examine the instructions used to compress the rule table itself.
</p>

<dl class="justified">
    <dt>RLUNCOMP <em>Value[0] Value[1] ... Value[65535]</em></dt>
        <dd>The entire contents of the lookup table is specified by the
                   65536 bytes that immediately follow this
                   instruction. <cite>CelLab</cite> never writes
                   rules in this format, but it will load rules
                   written with this instruction; it's provided
                   as a convenience to external programs that
                   want to generate rules without all the
                   complexity of compressing them.</dd>

    <dt>RLRUN <em>Count Value</em></dt>
        <dd>Store <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1  bytes of
                   <em>Value</em> in the next consecutive cells
                   of the lookup table.</dd>

    <dt>RLONEB <em>Value</em></dt>
        <dd>Store <em>Value</em> in the next cell of the lookup table.</dd>

    <dt>RLUNCS <em>Count Value[1] Value[2] &hellip; Value[Count+1]</em></dt>
        <dd>Store the <em>Count</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 bytes
                   specified by the <em>Value[n]</em> bytes in
                   the next cells of the rule table.</dd>

    <dt>RLCOPYB <em>Pageno</em></dt>
        <dd>The rule table is arbitrarily subdivided into 256
                   byte pages, numbered 0 through 255.  Due to
                   the structure of rules, often many pages will
                   be identical.  This instruction copies a
                   prior page, <em>Pageno</em>, and stores it in
                   the next 256 bytes of the rule table.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There isn't one uniquely correct way to compress a rule
table&mdash;rules may be encoded in various ways, but the
contents of the lookup table will be identical after the rule is
loaded.
</p>

<p>
The following instructions specify modes which the rule can
set.  The RLEND instruction both specifies modes and marks the
end of the rule definition; it is required.  All of the other
mode request instructions are optional&mdash;if they are not
specified the default values are used.  These instructions
convey the rule requests made by calls to the various
<span class="tt">set</span>&hellip; method invocations in the
<span class="tt">jcruleModes</span> method of a Java rule program or
setting the variables with the corresponding names in a
JavaScript rule program.  Please refer to the documentation of
these variables for details on their interpretation.
</p>

<dl class="justified">
    <dt>RLEND <em>worldtype randdens auxplane</em></dt>
        <dd>This instruction marks the end of the rule
            definition and conveys in the three bytes that
            follow the instruction code the settings the rule
            definition function stored in <em>worldtype,
            randdens,</em> and <em>auxplane</em>.  These values
            were used by earlier versions of <cite>CelLab</cite>
            and are now ignored. The process of loading a rule
            is ended after this instruction is processed
            (although if the file is a saved experiment, pattern
            and palette information may be present in the file
            following the RLEND instruction).</dd>

    <dt>RSHTEXT <em>texthb texthn</em></dt>
        <dd>Requests horizontal texture of <em>texthn</em> bits,
            starting at plane number
            <em>texthb</em>.</dd>

    <dt>RSVTEXT <em>textvb textvn</em></dt>
        <dd>Requests vertical texture of <em>textvn</em> bits,
           starting at plane number
           <em>textvb</em>.</dd>

    <dt>RSRAND <em>randb randn</em></dt>
        <dd>Requests random input each generation.
            <em>Randn</em> bits of random input are
            stored with the least significant bit in
            plane <em>randb</em>.</dd>

    <dt>RSRSEED <em>rseedb rseedn rseedp</em></dt>
        <dd>Requests that an initial random seed be stored when
            the rule is loaded or a new pattern is loaded
            while this rule is in effect.  The least
            significant bit of the random seed is stored
            in plane <em>rseedb</em> and <em>rseedn</em>
            bits of seed are stored.  The setting of
            <em>rseedp</em> controls the density of the
            seed&mdash;a value of 255 results in half the bits
            being zeroes, 0 generates all zeroes, and
            intermediate values vary the density between
            these limits.</dd>

Rule definition files are the most complex of the files used by
<cite>CelLab</cite>, but if you get confused about their format,
you can always examine the source code of the Java rule maker to
resolve any questions.

<h2 id="popcen">POPULATION CENSUS LOG FILES</h2>

<p>
<a href="webca.html#popcen">Population census</a>
log files consist of ASCII records in CSV
format indicating the population of cells in each state at the
time the log entry was made, whether manually or by an automatic
dump every so many generations.  Each record occupies a line in
the file and each record is of the form:
</p>

<p class="c">
    <em>generation</em><span class="tt">,</span><em>state</em><sub>1</sub><span class="tt">,</span><em>count</em><sub>1</sub><span class="tt">,</span>&hellip;
</p>

<p class="subsuper">
Where <em>generation</em> is the generation number at which the
population census was taken. the <em>state</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> and
<em>count</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> pairs give the number of cells in
each state.  States which have a <em>count</em> of zero are
omitted.  All numbers are decimal.
