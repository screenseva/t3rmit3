In <a href="refs.html#Feynman82">[Feynman82]</a>, Richard
Feynman seems to say that CAs cannot be a perfect model for the
world because nature does in fact have action at a distance in
the form of the kind of quantum mechanical synchronicities
discussed by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.  But it is
possible to write programs similar to CAs in which the cells do
occasionally look at distant neighbors.

The real reason is that if EveryCell could see eight bits of
each neighbor, then a &ldquo;situation&rdquo; would consist of
8&times;9 = 72 bits, and our exhaustive lookup table would have
a crippling 2<sup>72</sup> entries.  2<sup>72</sup> &asymp;
2<sup>70</sup> = 2<sup>10<sup> 7</sup></sup> = 1 K<sup>7</sup>
&asymp; (One Thousand)<sup>7</sup> =
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = One Sextillion.  No way.  Seeing
two bits of each neighbor is almost feasible; you'd need a
2<sup>24</sup> entry table, and 2<sup>24</sup> = (2<sup>4</sup>)
&times; (2<sup>20</sup>), or 16 Meg lookup table.  Meg is K's
big sister and means about a million.  Actually a lot of our
rules (like Ranch) do look at two bits of each neighbor; we do
it by running a rule that has two alternating cycles, looking at
bit #0 in cycle 0 and at bit #1 in cycle 1.  Sometimes people
say that no programs need all the new RAM and processor speed
being developed.  That's not true.  Cellular automata freaks can
eternally sop up whatever the chipsters have ready.

In some programming languages, <span class="tt">(A &minus; B)

upset the rule maker, causing it to emit error messages.  An easy
way to avoid this is to write <span class="tt">(2 + A &minus; B)
MOD 2</span> to ensure a positive value.  An alternative method,
if you know that <span class="tt">A</span> and <span

The Sierpi&#324;ski gasket is a shape you get by repeatedly
dividing a triangle into four subtriangles by connecting the
triangle's median points, then removing the middle triangle, and
applying the same process to the three remaining triangles.  The
name was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot
<a href="refs.html#Mandelbrot82">[Mandelbrot82]</a>, in homage to
the set-theorist Wac&#322;aw Sierpi&#324;ski, but the pattern
can also be found in Pascal's triangle, as the result of a
chaotic iteration

If we keep <em>B</em> down to 1, then EveryCell has 9 bits of
situation: one bit of self and eight bits of neighbor.  So the
lookup table has 2<sup>9</sup> or 512 lines.  If each

2<sup>512</sup> ways to fill in the table.  2<sup>512</sup> is a
good deal larger than googol, or 10<sup>100</sup>.  If

bits of self and eight bits of neighbor.  If the new state is to
be another four bit state, we have 2<sup>4</sup> choices for

The way I got this estimate was by following these steps:
</p>

<ol class="spaced">
    <li>Load the rule Brain, press &ldquo;Random&rdquo; to
        randomize, and run Brain for awhile.  Press
        &ldquo;Pause&rdquo; to stop.</li>
    <li>Erase the refractory cells (which live in plane 1)
        with the <a href="webca.html#bitplane">Bit Plane
        Editor</a>.</li>
    <li>Load the evaluator Meltdown by requesting
        <b>Meltdown</b> which is a variant of the
        <b>Safe-Pass</b> rule of 
        (<a href="refs.html#Margolus_Toffoli87">[Margolus&amp;Toffoli87]</a>,
        pp.&nbsp;77&ndash;80), and the rule program
        <b>Owncode</b>, which will apply the evaluator.</li>
    <li>Let Meltdown run till it has moved all the plane 0 cells
        down to form a pattern like a city skyline at the screen
        bottom. At this point you can form a pretty good
        estimate of how many of the screen's cells were firing
        brain cells because if you could break off the skyline's
        peaks and put them into the gaps, you'd get about six
        solid lines of plane 0 cells. Given that the screen has
        200 lines, this means 6/200 or 3% of them were firing
        cells.  As each firing cell immediately becomes
        refractory, there should have been an approximately
        equal number of refractory cells.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can also use the <a href="webca.html#popcen">population
census</a> to make such estimates.
</p>

<p class="back">
<input type="button" value="Back to text" onclick="history.back()" />
</p>

<p id="F4_7">
If <em>n</em>=0, then the rule has no refractory states, meaning
that state 1 goes directly back to state 0.  This means, in
turn, that conditions (ii) and (iv) can be omitted and that
condition (ii) would read &ldquo;A cell in state 1 goes to state
0.&rdquo; The Brain 0LU rules are ugly, with a nasty flicker.

<a href="refs.html#Rucker82">[Rucker82]</a>,
pp.&nbsp;38&ndash;39. <cite>Software</cite> has three main
characters: young Sta-Hi, old Cobb Anderson, and Ralph Numbers,
the first truly living robot. In the scene where Rainbow
appears, Sta-Hi has fallen into the hands of a demented redneck
cyberpunk gang called the Little Kidders.  The little Kidders are
Kristleen, Filthy Phil, Haf'n'Haf, Rainbow, and her boyfriend
Berdoo. They have Sta-Hi tightly bound, with his head sticking
up through a hole in the middle of a table.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a stuzzy high, Rainbow,&rdquo; Phil told her. With
the fat and the short hair he looked stupid, but his way of
speaking was precise and confident. He seemed to be the leader.
&ldquo;This should be a good brain, too. Full of chemicals, I
imagine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Haf'N'Haf seemed to be having some trouble starting the little
cutting machine up. It was a variable heat-blade. They were
going to cut off the top of Sta-Hi's skull and eat his brain
with those cheap steel spoons. He would be able to watch
them&hellip;at first.
</p>

<p>
Someone started screaming. Someone tried to stand up, but he was
tied too tightly. The variable blade was on now, set at one
centimeter. The thickness of the skull.
</p>

<p>
Sta-Hi threw his head back and forth wildly as Haf'N'Haf leaned
towards him. There was no way to read the ruined face's
expression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold still, damn you!&rdquo; Kristleen shouted.
&ldquo;It's no good if we have to knock you out!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sta-Hi didn't really hear her. His mind had temporarily snapped.
He just kept screaming and thrashing his head around. The sound
of his shrill voice was like a lattice around him. He tried to
weave the lattice thicker.
</p>

<p>
Berdoo went and got a towel from the bathroom.  He wedged it
around Sta-Hi's neck and under his chin to keep the head
steady.  Sta-Hi screamed louder, higher.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stuff his <em>mayouth</em>,&rdquo; the green-haired girl
cried. &ldquo;He's yellin and all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Phil said. &ldquo;The noise is
like&hellip;part of the trip. Wave with it, baby. The Chinese
used to do this to monkeys. It's so wiggly when you spoon out
the speech-centers and the guy's tongue stops moving. Just all
at&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and the flesh of his face moved in a
smile.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sta-Hi's given name is Stanley Hilary Mooney, Jr. Hearing of
Sta-Hi's narrow escape (he does escape), Stan Sr.'s reaction is
this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mooney felt trembly all over. He could only see the horrible
image of his son's dying eyes watching the Little Kidders chew
up his last thoughts. Mooney's tongue twitched, trying to flick
away the imagined taste of the brain tissue, tingly with firing
neurons, tart with transmitter chemicals.

time you discover something neat, you discover that Gauss or
Newton knew it in his crib. With LIFE you're the first guy
there, and there's always fun stuff going on. You can do
everything from recursive function theory to animal husbandry.
There's a community of people who are sharing their experiences
with you. And there's the sense of connection between you and

Where does the computer leave off and the environment begin?
